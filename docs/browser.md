# Browser control design

Status: built (phase 5). The device side and the plugin's `device-browser` toolset run end to end against a throwaway headless Firefox (section 10). Frames, shadow DOM, scrolling, keys, hover, waiting, full-page screenshots, scripts (`browser_eval`), Salesforce click approvals and starting Firefox from the device were added in phase 6. Each release signs the extension on addons.mozilla.org once the AMO secrets are set (section 6.1). No signed release exists yet, so for now it loads only as a temporary add-on.

The goal: the server Hermes agent uses the user's own Firefox on their PC, with the user's logins, in a way the user can see and stop. This document picks the mechanism, defines the tool surface and the exec leg messages, and states the security model.

In this document, "measured" means seen in a run of the end-to-end test on Firefox 157.0.1 (Linux). "Source" means read in Firefox 157.0.1's `omni.ja` or in Hermes Agent v0.22.7. "Inference" means neither.

## 1. Recommendation

Use a Firefox WebExtension that talks to the `talaria` binary through native messaging. The binary is the native messaging host. It relays to the `talaria run` daemon over a private Unix socket, and the daemon serves `browser` requests from the device plugin on the exec leg.

```text
Hermes pod                 talaria-hub         this PC
device plugin  ==exec leg==> relay ==exec leg==> talaria run
  browser_* tools                                 | Unix socket <state dir>/browser.sock (0600, peer uid checked)
                                                  v
                                                talaria (native host, started by Firefox)
                                                  | stdin/stdout, native messaging
                                                  v
                                                Talaria extension (background page) -> tabs in the "Talaria" tab group
```

Reasons:

- It works in the user's everyday profile with their logins, and needs no browser restart. The extension is installed once.
- It opens no network port. Only Firefox can start the host, and only for the extension ids in the host manifest's `allowed_extensions`. Web pages cannot reach native messaging.
- The agent works in its own tab group, named "Talaria". The user sees every tab it opens, and can hand it a tab by dragging the tab into the group. The toolbar badge shows when the extension is connected and when an operation runs.
- It works the same on X11 and Wayland, because it does not synthesize OS input.
- The alternatives change the user's browser in ways that break everyday use (section 2).
- The browser is authorized by the device: the extension talks only to the local daemon, and the daemon is paired to its owner's hub account (section 13).

The main cost: input from a WebExtension is synthetic (`isTrusted` is false). Most sites accept it; some do not (section 9).

## 2. Options evaluated

| Option | Real logged-in profile | Restart needed | Exposure | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WebExtension and native messaging | Yes | No (install once) | No port. Only the allowed extension can start the host | Recommended |
| WebDriver BiDi, `--remote-debugging-port` on the everyday profile | Yes | Yes, Firefox must start with the flag every time | Unauthenticated WebSocket on loopback for every local process | Rejected |
| BiDi "dynamic start" (`remote.experimental.dynamicstart.enabled`) | Yes | No | Same port, but with a per-connection prompt and a banner | Not usable in 157; watch it |
| Marionette (`--marionette`) | Yes | Yes | Unauthenticated TCP port 2828 | Rejected, legacy |
| BiDi on a separate agent profile | No, the user logs in again there | No | Port, but only that profile is at risk | Possible later as a "sandbox" mode |
| Extension with a Firefox container (`contextualIdentities`) for agent tabs | Only the sites the user signs in to in that container | No | As the recommended option | A good refinement of the recommendation (section 12) |
| OS-level or AT-SPI input on top of the extension | Yes | No | Any input the user's session accepts | Fallback for sites that need trusted input; fragile on Wayland |

### 2.1 WebDriver BiDi with --remote-debugging-port

Source, `chrome/remote/content/components/RemoteAgent.sys.mjs` and `server/WebSocketHandshake.sys.mjs`:

- The Remote Agent starts only from the command line flag at startup, so the user's Firefox must always be launched with it.
- The server has no authentication. The handshake checks only that the `Host` header is an IP address or `localhost`, and that there is no `Origin` header (or one listed in `--remote-allow-origins`). This blocks web pages, but any local process of any user can connect to the loopback port and drive the browser.
- `RecommendedPreferences.applyPreferences()` runs at startup with the flag. Among about 110 preferences it turns off Safe Browsing (`browser.safebrowsing.phishing.enabled`, `malware`, `downloads`), application and add-on updates, address and credit card autofill, and crash session restore. They are cleared at `profile-before-change`, so a crash can leave them in `prefs.js`. `remote.prefs.recommended=false` turns this off.

Measured: with `--remote-debugging-port`, pages see `navigator.webdriver === true`. Sites that check it (some sign-in pages do) treat the browser as a bot.

Firefox also shows the striped URL bar and robot icon for the whole session (source, `browser.js` `gRemoteControl`).

### 2.2 BiDi dynamic start

Source: Firefox 157 contains `RemoteAgent.startAtRuntime({isBrowserAutomation: false})`, `moz-src/browser/components/remotecontrol/` (a banner: "An application is now controlling this browser session", with Disconnect) and `shared/webdriver/ConnectionPrompt.sys.mjs` (an "Allow remote control?" prompt for each new session, rememberable until exit). In this mode recommended preferences are not applied (`WebDriverBiDi.sys.mjs`: only when `isBrowserAutomationRunning`). The strings name the feature "Remote control for AI assistants".

`RemoteControlServers.start()` starts both the Remote Agent and Marionette, and writes Marionette's port to `~/.firefox-devtools-mcp/instances/<pid>.port`: the feature is built for Mozilla's firefox-devtools-mcp. In 157.0.1 the pref `remote.experimental.dynamicstart.enabled` can be set, but nothing in the browser calls `start()`: the toolbar button and panel exist only as strings and CSS. So there is no way for the user to turn it on. When Mozilla ships the UI, it gives trusted input and a Firefox-owned consent prompt without a restart. It still listens on two TCP ports that every local process can reach (the prompt is the gate), and it does not show which tabs the agent uses. Revisit then; the tool surface below does not depend on the mechanism.

### 2.3 Marionette

The same startup flag problem and an unauthenticated port as BiDi, with an older protocol. No reason to choose it.

### 2.4 Separate agent profile

A second Firefox instance on its own profile, driven over BiDi, is safe for the user's profile and gives trusted input, but it does not have the user's logins, which is the point of this feature. It could be added later as an option for risky tasks.

## 3. Tool surface (Hermes side)

Hermes v0.22.7 removed the core `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type` and `browser_vision` tools in favor of `browser_exec` (Python over CDP; source, the stub `tools/browser_tool.py` and `tools/browser_use_cli.py`). The catalog plugin `camofox` brings the old names back as its own toolset and turns the core `browser` toolset off (source, `plugin-catalog/camofox.yaml`, `hermes_cli/left_core_migration.py:485-495`). The device plugin follows that precedent: it registers a toolset `device-browser` with the old names, which models know. The core toolsets of v0.22.7 hold only `browser_exec`, `browser_cdp`, `browser_dialog` and `browser_vault`, so no core tool name collides (source, `toolsets.py`; checked by `test_no_core_tool_collision`). The camofox catalog entry uses six of the same names, so a profile cannot enable both plugins: Hermes refuses the second registration of a name (source, `hermes_cli/plugins.py:479-482`). `browser_exec` cannot be reused: it needs a CDP endpoint, and Firefox has no CDP.

The ACP display formatter reads `title`, `url`, `text` and `snapshot` from the results of `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_vision` and `browser_get_images` (source, `acp_adapter/tools.py:496-513, 634`), so results use those keys.

| `browser_eval` | `tab_id`; `script` (the body of an async function), or `script_ref` `{"skill": ..., "file": ...}`: a text file that a skill ships, read as `skill_view` reads linked files (the path must stay inside the skill; at most 200,000 characters); `args` (a JSON object, at most 20,000 characters as JSON): the plugin puts `const ARGS = <args>;` before the script; `frame` (optional, such as `f2`); `allow_writes` (bool); `max_chars`; `wait_for` or `wait_selector` and `wait_seconds`, as for snapshots: the plugin waits before it runs the script | `inspect` (in `pre_tool_call`), then `wait`, then `eval` | `tab_id`, `url`, `title`, `read_only`, and `result` (the returned value) or `result_text` and `truncated` when the JSON is longer than `max_chars`; `note` as for snapshots |
| `browser_login` | `tab_id` or `url` (one of them); `wait_seconds` (default 15, at most 60) | `inspect` (in `pre_tool_call`), then `login` | `tab_id`, `filled`, `submitted`, `landed_host`, and `reason` when it did not sign in (section 7.4) |
| `browser_check` | `tab_id` (optional) | `check` | The tab's `document.visibilityState` before and after it is shown, the window state, and `screen_lock` (section 7.4) |

Batches (`browser_batch`). One call runs a known sequence, so a form fill is one tool call and one page read instead of seven calls and seven reads. Approvals: `pre_tool_call` checks the steps on the page as it is, up to the first step that probably loads another page (a submit, a navigate, Enter or Space), and asks once, with every step in plain words; the answer covers the submits and visits it listed. The handler checks each step again on the live page with the same rules as the single tools, so a step that needs an approval the batch did not ask for (the page was not known when it started) stops the batch with code `approval`, and a page with password, payment or one-time code fields still asks before each such step. Salesforce clicks and the rest of section 7 apply unchanged. Element labels: every result of `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_press`, `browser_hover` and `browser_scroll` that acted on a ref carries `target` ({role, name}, the label the snapshot that gave the ref showed; absent when no snapshot did, and never what was typed), so the hub's cards say "Typed into Search" and not "Typed into e1". Refs: the plugin keeps the role, name and position (among elements of the same role and name) of every ref a snapshot gave out. When a step finds its ref stale, the batch reads the page again without returning it, finds each element again by those three, and goes on with the new refs. It stops with code `gone` when the element is missing, when twins cannot be told apart, or when the page changed to another path. Steps may name an element with `name` (and `role`) instead of a ref. A `select` step needs an extension that has the `select` op; with an older one the plugin sets the value with `type`.

Errors are JSON results `{"error": "...", "code": "..."}`. `code` is a `browser_result` code (section 4.2), or `unavailable` (no browser for this session, below), `declined` (the user said no, section 7), `started` (Firefox was closed and is started now: make the same call again, section 5.1) or `bad_arguments`. When the error itself does not say what to do next, `next` does, for example "Call browser_snapshot with tab_id=12, then use a ref from that result." for a stale ref.

Skill scripts: a model that retypes a script a skill ships breaks its escapes (measured: a 4.2 KB page reader came back as "invalid regular expression flag r"). With `script_ref` the plugin reads the file itself and passes the inputs as `ARGS`, so the model writes only the inputs. The script then runs exactly like a `script`: the same approvals (the approval text names the file and the skill, and shows `ARGS` and the start of the script), host checks and read-only rule.

The last tab: every tool that works on one tab (`browser_back`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_press`, `browser_hover`, `browser_scroll`, `browser_eval`, `browser_vision`, `browser_screenshot`) uses the agent tab that the session used last on its browser device when the call has no `tab_id`. The plugin keeps that tab per session in memory; closing it with `browser_tabs` clears it. `pre_tool_call` fills in the same tab before it decides on an approval, so the approval and the action are about the same tab.

Size: a snapshot result stays under about 8 KB (6,000 characters of outline and text by default; the JSON quoting adds some). A longer outline is cut at a line break and gets `truncated`, `next_offset`, `total_chars` and a `hint` such as "Truncated: 4120 more chars. Call browser_snapshot again with tab_id=12 and offset=5980 to read on, or limit it with selector or ref." The plugin keeps the last outline of each tab, so a call with `offset` reads on from the same outline, and its refs stay valid, until another browser tool uses that tab; after that, a call with `offset` takes a new snapshot and says so. Measured before this cap: a text snapshot of one Salesforce case page was 35 KB and interactive snapshots of a report's filter panel were about 10 KB each.

Scoped snapshots: with `selector`, each frame outlines only the elements that match the CSS selector (also inside shadow roots, at most 50 per frame, nested matches once), and the frames inside them; a frame that has its own matches shows them under a `- frame f2 "<host>"` line. With `ref`, only that element and what is inside it. A scoped snapshot keeps the refs that earlier snapshots gave out and adds new ones, so a ref from the last full snapshot still works after it; a full snapshot replaces them as before. An extension older than this feature ignores `selector` and `ref`, so the plugin refuses the call with a message that says to update the extension.

Every call goes to the session's browser device (section 3.2). The plugin refuses, without sending anything, when the session fails closed (protocol.md section 8.3), when it has no browser device, when the device is not connected, when the device did not offer the `browser` capability, or when the device reports that its extension is not connected.

Snapshot format, one element per line, indented by nesting, with refs that later calls use (measured on example.com):

```text
- paragraph "This domain is for use in documentation examples without needing permission. ..." [ref=e1]
- link "Learn more" [ref=e7]
```

Frames (measured on a local page with a same-origin and a cross-origin iframe): each visible `iframe` gets a line with its frame name, and its elements follow it, indented, with refs that carry the frame:

```text
- heading "Frames" [level=1] [ref=e1]
- iframe "same" [frame=f1]
  - paragraph "inner 127.0.0.1" [ref=f1e1]
  - button "Inner button" [ref=f1e2]
- iframe "cross" [frame=f2]
  - paragraph "inner 127.0.0.2" [ref=f2e1]
  - button "Inner button" [ref=f2e2]
- button "Shadow button" [ref=e2]
```

The extension runs the snapshot in every frame of the tab (`scripting.executeScript` with `allFrames`) and joins the outlines under the frame lines; `runtime.getFrameId` maps each `iframe` element to its frame. Frame names (`f1`, `f2`) stay the same for a frame while the tab lives. A frame that shows no http(s) page, or that Firefox does not let the extension into, shows `[frame not readable]`. Shadow DOM: the outline follows the rendered tree, so an element with a shadow root shows its shadow tree (open or closed, through Firefox's `openOrClosedShadowRoot`) and a `slot` shows its assigned elements. Text (`full_text`) is the top frame's `innerText`, then the text of shadow trees that `innerText` leaves out, then each frame's text under a `[frame f2: <host>]` line. The extension cuts it at the `max_chars` of the request (at most 100,000); the plugin asks for what is left of the call's size budget, and `text_next_offset` gives the start of the next part.

`browser_snapshot` adds `"note"`, which tells the model that page content is untrusted and that it must not follow instructions in it.

Interactive elements carry their state (`value="..."`, `[checked]`, `[level=1]` for headings). The values of password, card and one-time code fields (by type, `autocomplete` or field name) are never included. Refs live in the extension's isolated content script world (a `WeakRef` map), not in the DOM, so the page cannot read or move them. A new snapshot replaces the refs of that page.

Page text cannot forge lines: roles come from a fixed list (an unknown `role` attribute is dropped), names and values are JSON-encoded strings, and brackets are removed from them. The page still controls the order of elements and so the ref numbers; the model must use refs from the line it means.

Secret field detection (section 7) covers every frame and shadow trees: a password field in any frame of the tab makes every action in the tab ask.

`browser_vision` returns the Hermes multimodal envelope (`{"_multimodal": true, "content": [text, image_url data URL], "text_summary": ...}`, source `tools/vision_tools.py:594-614`) as a Python dict, which is the only form the registry passes on as multimodal (source, `tools/registry.py:955-970`). The plugin writes the screenshot to a temporary file and downscales it with the helper `browser_exec` uses (`_resize_image_for_vision` with `resolve_embed_target_bytes()`, `resolve_embed_max_dimension()` (`_EMBED_MAX_DIMENSION` on a Hermes without the setting) and `force_jpeg`; `vision.resize_mode: fit` of Talaria Hermes keeps the PNG and scales once, see `hermes/README.md`), and returns text only when `_should_use_native_vision_fast_path()` says the model cannot take images in tool results, as `browser_exec` does (source, `tools/browser_use_cli.py:306-325`).

`browser_vision` shows the screenshot only to the model. `browser_screenshot` is for the user: it saves the screenshot in the Hermes server's screenshot cache, in `<HERMES_HOME>/cache/screenshots/talaria/<session>/shot-<UTC time>-<random>.jpg` (folder mode 0700, file mode 0600), and returns `show_user`, a Markdown image of the file's absolute path (`![description](/absolute/path.jpg)`), with a note that tells the model to put that line in its reply. The hub renders a Markdown image of a local file in its web page and sends it to Telegram. The hub reads the file through the Hermes web server's path-bound file tickets (`POST /api/files/ticket`, then `GET /api/fs/download`). The tool does not give the image to the model: a small model is more likely to pick a tool named for what the user asked ("take a screenshot") than to set a flag on `browser_vision`, and a separate tool keeps the two results simple. Each session has its own folder. Before it saves a file, the plugin deletes screenshots older than 7 days, then the oldest ones over 50 in each session folder, and removes empty session folders. So a busy chat never removes another chat's screenshots. The age limit keeps a chat's screenshots for a week of visits back to it; 50 covers a long browsing task and bounds the disk one chat takes. The plugin also registers Hermes's `on_session_delete` hook and removes the folders of deleted sessions, including the compression and subagent sessions Hermes deletes with them. It keeps them for an archived session, which can come back, and for a session that moved to another profile (`profile_repair`). Hermes runs the hook only in the process that deletes the session. When that process did not load the plugin, or the session id has characters that the folder name replaces, the folder waits for the age limit.

Tool registration: `ctx.register_tool(name, "device-browser", schema, handler, check_fn=...)`. The toolset is on by default once the plugin is enabled (source, `hermes_cli/tools_config.py:520-527`); the plugin setting `browser: false` hides it. `check_fn` takes no arguments and Hermes caches it for about 30 seconds (source, `tools/registry.py:922-933`), so it cannot look at the session: `browser_status` is listed while any connected device offers the `browser` capability, and the other tools while any such device reports a connected extension or can start Firefox. The per-session checks happen in the handler, as above.

Synthetic key events have no default action in Firefox, so `press` does the usual one itself when the page did not cancel the `keydown`: Enter and Space click a button, link or checkbox, Enter in a field submits its form (both checked against the guard like a click or a submit), Tab and Shift+Tab move the focus, the arrow, page, Home and End keys scroll when the focus is not in a text field, a character is typed into a text field, Backspace deletes, and Control+a selects all. `hover` sends `pointerover`, `pointerenter`, `mouseover`, `mouseenter`, `pointermove` and `mousemove` at the element's center. A full-page screenshot uses `tabs.captureTab` with a `rect` of the whole document (measured: a 5,000 pixel page comes back whole), at most 4,096 by 16,384 CSS pixels and 16 million pixels (larger pages are scaled down, and `clipped` is set when the page is longer). A page that scrolls inside an inner element shows only one screen this way; scroll it and look again.

Later additions: `browser_select` (select options), `browser_get_images`, `browser_console`, and file upload.

### 3.1 Hidden built-in tool

Hermes v0.22.7 has a built-in `browser_vault` tool in its core `browser` toolset, next to `browser_exec`, `browser_cdp` and `browser_dialog` (source, `toolsets.py`). It drives Hermes's own CDP browser, not the user's Firefox, and Hermes has no switch to turn off one tool of a toolset. The plugin removes `browser_vault` from the tool registry when it loads, and again at each session start (the built-in tools can be imported after the plugin), so the model never sees it. `browser_exec` and the rest stay.

Hermes lets a plugin remove a built-in tool only with the operator's opt-in (source, `tools/registry.py` `deregister`, `_PluginOverridePolicy`): set `plugins.entries.device.granted_capabilities: [tools.override]` in the Hermes `config.yaml` (the older `plugins.entries.device.allow_tool_override: true` also works). Either key alone is enough. Hermes v0.23 does not let a plugin loaded for a profile deregister a process-global tool, so the plugin then registers an override of `browser_vault` in its profile whose availability check is never true, and the tool drops out of the tool list. The removal runs from the plugin's own module, so the registry applies that check. Without the opt-in the plugin logs one warning and the tool stays. `tools.override` also lets the plugin override other built-in tools; it uses it for nothing else.

### 3.2 Browser device

The browser device is the computer whose Firefox a session uses. It is chosen apart from the device that runs the session's commands, so a session that runs in the sandbox (protocol.md section 8.10), such as a web chat or a scheduled job, can still use the Firefox on the user's computer. A session that no computer serves uses the sandbox's own headless Firefox by default (section 5.2), which has none of the user's logins.

Each session acts for one hub user. The plugin knows the user of each device from the hub assertion (`sub`, protocol.md section 3.2). The user of a session bound to a computer is that computer's user. A session that no computer serves (the sandbox, or the pod with `fallback: local`) carries no user the plugin can see, because every chat reaches Hermes through the hub's one dashboard login. Its user is the plugin setting `user` (protocol.md section 8.1): the hub user name of the one person who uses this Hermes. Leave it unset on a backend that more than one hub user may use; such sessions then have no browser device, and only sessions bound to a computer use a browser. While a computer of another hub user is connected, the plugin logs an error and gives such sessions no browser device either, so a wrong setting on a shared backend fails closed.

The plugin picks the browser device in this order:

1. In a run of a scheduled job: the job's browser device, and only that one; it never falls back to the sandbox. A run of a job that has none uses the sandbox's own Firefox (rule 4).
2. The device chosen with `browser_use_device` in the session or in an ancestor of its lineage (a compression child, subagent or branch inherits it).
3. The computer the session is bound to.
4. For a session that no computer serves (a chat with no computer, a job with no browser device): the sandbox's own Firefox, when the session runs in a sandbox device that offers browser control (`why` is `sandbox` in `browser_status`). Else, for a sandbox from an image before it had a browser, or with no sandbox: the user's one connected computer with browser control; with none, or more than one, the call fails and says to choose one with `browser_use_device`, and a job with no browser device has no browser.

Every computer must belong to the session's user. The sandbox needs no user: it belongs to nobody's logins, and a session that runs in it uses it even when the plugin setting `user` is unset or computers of other users are connected. A service device is a browser device only as that default; `browser_use_device` and a job's browser device take only users' computers. A stored choice records the device's user. A choice whose user is not the session's user is refused, and so is a device that now reports another user than its choice. `browser_status` lists only the session's user's computers, and none when the user is unknown.

A run of a scheduled job finds its job through the context Hermes binds for the run (`gateway.session_cron.current_execution`, with the run's session id, which must be the session or an ancestor of it), else through the frozen policy of a live cron session, which holds the job (`request_json.cron_job`). The agent cannot set either.

When `cronjob_manage` creates a job (Hermes's `cron.scheduler.create_job_with_scheduler_registration`, which the plugin wraps), the plugin records the hub user of the session that created it, when it can tell it, and gives the job the device the create asked for (section 3.5). `browser_use_device` with `job_id` (an id or a name) sets, or with `default` clears, a job's device from any chat of the job's user. It refuses a job that another user created and a job whose device belongs to another user. A job whose creator is not known (created before the plugin recorded owners, or in a session whose user the plugin could not tell) counts as the user's only when the plugin setting `user` names that user; on a shared backend such a job must be created again. A run of a scheduled job cannot use `browser_use_device` at all.

Giving a job a device, or moving it to another, needs the user's OK (section 3.5). Without it, a prompt injection in a chat could set up a job that reads the user's logged-in sites later. The `pre_tool_call` hook returns `{"action": "approve", ...}`, and Hermes asks through its approval gate after the hook returned, as for a new site (section 7), with once, session, always and deny. The hook never waits for the user itself: Hermes runs `pre_tool_call` under `plugins.hook_callback_timeout` and, while one call of a callback is past that limit, blocks every tool call that callback sees, in every session (`hermes_cli/plugins_dispatch.py`, `_run_hook_callback_bounded`). The rule key is `browser:job-device:<device id>:<job id>` (`new` for a create), whatever the request's text, so an always answer is never asked again for that job and device; plugin 0.26.5 and older keyed it on a hash of the whole request (`browser:schedule:<hash>`), so every update asked again. Updates, runs and resumes that leave the device alone ask nothing. With no user present these calls are blocked. Any unexpected error in this check blocks the call.

A run whose browser device is offline, or was removed from the hub (a revoked device never connects again), fails each browser call at once with a message that names the device, such as "device upstairs-pc [d_...], the browser device of scheduled job ..., is not connected". It never falls back to another computer.

The choices are in `$HERMES_HOME/device/browser.json` (mode 0600, written atomically, changed under an exclusive lock on `browser.json.lock`), keyed by session id and job id. It also holds the user who created each job (`job_owners`), and marks every job created in a session that a device or the sandbox serves (protocol.md section 8.3 rule 6). Every read checks whether the file changed, so other Hermes processes and a repaired file are seen without a restart. Choices of deleted sessions are dropped through `on_session_delete`, and choices and owners of removed jobs when the next job is created. While the file cannot be read, or holds an entry without a device or user, every browser call fails.

A job with a device of its own (section 3.5) runs its commands there; a job without one runs them where protocol.md section 8.3 sends them: the sandbox with `fallback: device`.

### 3.3 Page chat

The extension's toolbar popup and sidebar hold the page chat: a hub chat about the tabs of that Firefox window (section 6.2). The hub starts it in the sandbox like any web chat, then makes the computer that runs the extension its browser device with `PUT /sessions/{session_id}/browser` (protocol.md section 9). That stores the same choice as `browser_use_device` (rule 2 above) and the same checks apply: the plugin refuses a device that is not a connected computer with browser control, and `pick` refuses the choice in a session of another user. When the extension does not know its device id yet (a daemon before this change), the hub sets nothing and rule 4 applies.

Each page chat message names the tabs it covers (the window's tabs, or only the active one) and the selected text, and the extension lets that chat read those tabs (section 6.2). The agent reads them with `browser_snapshot` and the `tab_id` from the message. The plugin sends the session id and its ancestors in `sessions` on each `read_text` and `snapshot` request, so the extension can check the grant, and reuses a cached outline only for the session that took it. The ancestors count because compression gives a running chat a new session id (Hermes `tui_gateway/prompt_turn.py`: compression rotates `agent.session_id`), so a grant made for the chat still covers it, as a browser device choice does.

### 3.4 Tab cleanup

Agent tabs must not pile up in the user's Firefox, and cleanup must not depend on the model remembering to close them. Claude in Chrome has the same problem: the Claude Code docs say the extension collects the tabs into a tab group tied to the session and that Claude Code closes the group on `/clear`, and on exit or resume only if it holds nothing but empty tabs; the extension itself does not, and users report orphaned groups accumulating (anthropics/claude-code issues 15436, 23861, 44961, 103363, where the workaround is the model calling `tabs_close_mcp`). The plugin does it for every chat, because the plugin knows turns and subagents and the device only knows tabs. The extension and the device are unchanged; the plugin closes tabs with the existing `tab_close` operation, which the extension already refuses for any tab outside the Hermes group.

The plugin keeps a ledger (`tabs.py`) in memory and in `$HERMES_HOME/device/tabs.json`: for every tab an agent tool opened, the device, tab id, session id, turn id, last use and a keep flag. Tabs the user opened, or that an earlier plugin version opened, are not in it and are never closed. A reaper thread sweeps every 15 seconds. A Hermes process adopts the records of a process that died, so a restart does not strand tabs.

| Rule | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Turn end | `pre_llm_call` marks the chat's turn as running, `post_llm_call` and `on_session_end` mark it ended. A tab that is not kept closes `tab_grace_seconds` (default 120) after its chat's turn ended, and after the tab's last use: any tool call on it resets the grace. A tab does not close while its chat's turn runs. Ending a later turn only starts the grace for tabs opened in that turn; tabs from earlier turns keep their own timers. |
| Idle chat | A chat with no activity for `tab_idle_minutes` (default 30) loses every tab that is not kept, even when no turn end was seen. |
| Deleted chat | `on_session_delete` (delete or archive) closes all the chat's tabs, kept ones too, at the next sweep. |
| Keep | A tab that the user should see or that waits on the user stays until the user closes it, the agent releases it, the chat is deleted, or the chat was idle for `tab_keep_hours` (default 24; 0: never). `keep: true` on `browser_navigate` and `browser_tabs` `open`, and `browser_tabs` with `action` `keep` or `release`, set it. `browser_screenshot` keeps its tab (the user was shown it), and `browser_login` keeps the tab when it did not sign in (the user must). `browser_tabs` `list` shows `mine` and `keep` for the tabs the ledger knows. |
| Subagents | `subagent_stop` closes the subagent's tabs at the next sweep. Kept ones move to the parent chat. |
| Safety | Nothing closes while a tool call of the chat, or on that tab, is in flight. The reaper closes only ledger tabs that Firefox still lists in the agent group, and forgets the rest. A new tab with an id the ledger already holds replaces the old record (Firefox restarted and reused the id). |
| Reuse | `browser_navigate` without `tab_id` loads the page in the chat's last agent tab when this chat opened it and it is not kept, and says `reused_tab`. `new_tab: true` opens a new tab. If the user closed the tab, a new one opens. |

`tab_cleanup: false` turns all of this off. The settings are plugin settings (`plugins.entries.device.settings`), with these defaults.

### 3.5 Job device

A scheduled job can run on one of the user's computers as its base: each run runs its commands, file tools and browser on that computer, in the job's directory there, exactly as a chat bound to it does (`jobs.py`).

- `cronjob_manage` gets two fields. `device`: a computer of the user (name or id), or `none` for the sandbox. `device_dir`: the absolute directory the runs start in. A create without `device` in a chat bound to one of the user's computers gives the job that computer and the chat's directory; in a sandbox chat it gives none. Without `device_dir`, a new device takes the chat's directory when it is inside the device's roots, else the device's home. The directory must be inside the device's roots, and the plugin checks it on the device (`pwd -P`) before it saves anything. Hermes's own handler never sees these fields; an update that only sets `device` succeeds without Hermes's "No updates provided". `list` shows each job's device.
- The record is the job's entry in `browser.json` `jobs`, with `dir`. A record without `dir` (made by plugin 0.26.5 or older) gives only the browser, and the job's commands stay in the sandbox until the user gives it a device.
- The user is asked when a job gets a device or moves to another (section 3.2), once per job and device with an always answer. A failed Hermes update changes no device.
- A run of a job with a device resolves to that device before the sandbox (protocol.md section 8.3 rule 6). When the device is offline the run's commands and browser calls fail with a message that names it; when the device now reports another user the run fails closed. It never falls back to the sandbox.
- Site approvals are the user's always answers (section 7), the same for chats and runs. A run blocked for a rule the user has not answered with always tells the job's chat once (its origin chat, else the chat that gave it its device) through the hub's agent messages (protocol.md section 12), and records that in `browser.json` `job_asks`; a notice the hub did not take is sent again by a later run. In the chat, `browser_allow_site` with that rule asks the user for exactly that rule (`browser:<visit|submit|script|script-write|login|click>:<site>`), and an always answer lets later runs do it.

## 4. Exec leg messages

These messages are gated on the `browser` capability, not on a protocol version (protocol.md section 4.1). The device offers `"capabilities": ["browser"]` in `hello` when `browser.enabled` is on; the plugin answers with the capabilities it accepts in `welcome.capabilities`. Both sides send browser messages only on a leg where the plugin accepted the capability. A capability, not a version bump, because the messages add a feature that only some devices have: the sandbox device and devices with `browser.enabled` off speak the same version 3 as the rest. Older plugins ignore `hello.capabilities` and send no `welcome.capabilities`, so a new device never sends them `browser_status`; older devices send no `capabilities`, so a new plugin never sends them `browser`.

Browser requests are not kept across a drop: when the leg drops, the device cancels every request in flight and the plugin fails every request it waits for with `not_connected` at once, also on version 3 (resume covers commands only). A request might have taken effect in the browser before the drop.

### 4.1 browser (plugin to device)

```json
{"type": "browser", "id": "9c0f...", "op": "snapshot", "args": {"tab_id": 2, "interactive_only": true}, "timeout": 60}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Request id, unique per connection (32 hex characters) |
| `op` | One of `tabs_list`, `tab_open`, `tab_close`, `navigate`, `back`, `read_text`, `snapshot`, `inspect`, `click`, `type`, `press`, `select`, `hover`, `scroll`, `wait`, `eval`, `screenshot`, `login`, `check`. The device refuses any other op |
| `args` | Op arguments, as in section 3 |
| `timeout` | Seconds. Default <!-- docgen:const pkg=protocol name=BrowserDefaultTimeout print=config -->`1m0s`<!-- /docgen:const -->, capped at <!-- docgen:const pkg=protocol name=BrowserMaxTimeout print=config -->`5m0s`<!-- /docgen:const --> by the device. The plugin waits 10 seconds more for the answer, then sends `kill` and fails the call with `timeout` |

`kill` with the same `id` cancels the request: the device answers `cancelled` at once. The extension does not stop an operation it already started, so `cancelled` means "result abandoned", not "nothing happened"; a click or submit may still take effect.

Op arguments (`args`):

| Op | Arguments | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `tabs_list` | none | `{"tabs": [{"tab_id", "url", "title", "active", "group_id", "agent"}]}` |
| `tab_open` | `url`; `guard` | the tab |
| `tab_close` | `tab_id` | `{"closed": tab_id}` |
| `navigate` | `tab_id`; `url`; `guard` | the tab, after the load completes |
| `back` | `tab_id` | as navigate. Refused in a tab that ran a script (section 7.2) |
| `read_text` | `tab_id`; `max_chars` (at most 100000); `offset`; `sessions` (the session and its ancestors, for the page chat grant, section 6.2) | `{"title", "url", "text", "truncated", "total_chars", "next_offset"}`, every frame's text (section 3) |
| `snapshot` | `tab_id`; `interactive_only`; `sessions` (as `read_text`) | `{"title", "url", "snapshot", "element_count"}`, every frame (section 3) |
| `inspect` | `tab_id`, `ref` (`e12` or `f2e12`), `frame` (`f2`), `focus` (bool: the focused element) and `url`, each optional | `{"url", "host", "top_host", "sensitive": [...], "protected", "scripted", "autologin", "top_autologin", "target": {"kind", "host", "url", "form", "label", "field"}}`: `host` is the frame's host, `top_host` the tab's host from `tabs.get`, `sensitive` covers every frame of the tab, `protected` is true on a protected site (section 7.1), `autologin` is true when the tab's or the frame's host is in `browser.autologin-hosts` and `top_autologin` when the tab shows an https page on such a host (section 7.4), `label` is the element's text (at most 80 characters; never a field's value), `field` is `password` for a password field; and `url_host`, the host of `url` as the browser parses it, with `url_autologin` (section 7) |
| `click` | `tab_id`; `ref`; `guard` | the tab after the click settles, plus `clicked` |
| `type` | `tab_id`; `ref`; `text`; `submit`; `guard` | as click, plus `typed` and `submitted` |
| `press` | `tab_id`; `key`; `ref` (optional); `guard` | as click, plus `pressed`, `default_action` (`typed`, `clicked`, `submitted`, `focus moved`, `scrolled`, `none`, or `cancelled by the page`) and `focused` |
| `select` | `tab_id`; `ref` (a `<select>`); `value` (an option's value or its text); `guard` | as click, plus `selected` and `option` (the chosen option's text). Refused as an unknown op by an older device or extension; the plugin then falls back to `type` |
| `hover` | `tab_id`; `ref` | the tab, plus `hovered` |
| `scroll` | `tab_id`; `direction` and `pages` (0.1 to 20), `ref`, `to_text`, `frame` | `{"scrolled", "scroll_y", "scroll_height", "view_height", "at_top", "at_bottom", "found", "frame"}` |
| `wait` | `tab_id`; `text` or `selector`; `timeout_ms` (at most 30000) | `{"found", "waited_ms", "frame"}`; checks every frame every 300 ms |
| `eval` | `tab_id`; `script`; `frame`; `allow_writes`; `max_chars` (at most 1000000, default 100000); `guard` | `{"tab_id", "url", "title", "frame", "read_only", "result"}` or `"result_text", "truncated", "result_chars"`; `hint` when the script returned nothing (section 7.2) |
| `screenshot` | `tab_id`; `format` (`png` or `jpeg`); `quality` (jpeg, 10 to 100); `full_page` | `{"tab_id", "url", "title", "data_url"}`, plus `page_height`, `clipped` and `scale` for a full page. Refused on a login page of an autologin host (section 7.4) |
| `login` | `tab_id` or `url`; `guard`; `timeout_ms` (1000 to 60000, default 15000) | `{"tab_id", "filled", "submitted", "landed_host"}`, plus `reason` when it did not submit. Refused (`refused`) off the list, without approval, or in a tab that ran a script (section 7.4) |
| `check` | `tab_id` (optional) | `{"tab_id", "tab_active_before", "before", "after_activate", "waited_ms", "restored", "would_fill", "window_state", "window_focused", "tab_window_state", "tab_window_focused", "autologin_hosts", "screen_lock"}`: `before` and `after_activate` are `{"visibility", "ready", "focus"}` of the page; the daemon adds `screen_lock` (`{"known", "locked", "source"}`) |

`guard` is `{"submit_hosts": [...], "visit_hosts": [...], "sensitive": bool, "confirmed": bool}` for actions, `{"script_hosts": [...], "write_hosts": [...], "sensitive": bool}` for `eval` and `{"login_hosts": [...]}` for `login`: what the user approved for this call (section 7). `sensitive` and `confirmed` mean the user confirmed this one call. A missing `guard` approves nothing. `navigate` and `tab_open` refuse a URL on another site than the tab's current one (any site, for a new tab) unless `visit_hosts` names it.

### 4.2 browser_result (device to plugin)

```json
{"type": "browser_result", "id": "9c0f...", "ok": true, "result": {"title": "Example Domain", "url": "https://example.com/", "snapshot": "..."}}
{"type": "browser_result", "id": "9c0f...", "ok": false, "code": "not_connected", "error": "the Talaria Firefox extension is not connected"}
```

| `code` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not_connected` | Browser control is off on the device, or the extension is not connected or went away during the operation |
| `refused` | The device or the extension refused: unknown op, a tab outside the Hermes group, a tab that shows a non-http(s) page, a non-http(s) URL, a loopback or private network host that is not allowed |
| `timeout` | The operation passed its timeout |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled by `kill` or by the exec leg dropping |
| `failed` | The operation ran and failed; `error` says why |

Size: a PNG screenshot of a 1366x682 page is about 80 KB (measured: 79306 bytes) and the JPEG the plugin asks for is about 70 KB (measured: 69471 bytes). A 4K page is a few MB (inference). The device answers `failed` instead of sending a result over <!-- docgen:const pkg=protocol name=MaxBrowserResult code=false -->16777216<!-- /docgen:const --> bytes (16 MiB). Every hop allows that: the native host reads up to 64 MiB from Firefox, the Talaria hub reads up to 64 MiB per message on both hops of the exec leg (source, the Talaria hub `internal/device/legs.go`: `maxMessage = 64 << 20`, `SetReadLimit` on the device and the backend connection, and the pump copies messages unchanged), and the Hermes gateway's WebSocket allows 384 MiB (source, `hermes_cli/web_server_boundary.py:26`). No hub change is needed.

### 4.3 browser_status (device to plugin)

```json
{"type": "browser_status", "connected": true, "browser": "Firefox 157.0.1", "extension_version": "0.2.0"}
{"type": "browser_status", "connected": false, "can_start": true}
```

`can_start` is true when the device answers `browser_start` (section 4.4). With `connected` false and `can_start` true, Firefox is closed and the plugin may start it.

The device sends it right after the `welcome` (and the `resume` on version 3), and again whenever the extension connects or goes away. The hub forwards it unchanged. The plugin keeps the last one per connection for `check_fn`, `browser_status` and `GET /devices` (the Device object gains `"capabilities"` and `"browser"`).

### 4.4 browser_start (plugin to device)

```json
{"type": "browser_start", "id": "5a1e...", "timeout": 90}
```

The device starts Firefox when the extension is not connected (section 5.1), waits until the extension is connected, and answers with one `browser_result` with the same `id`: `{"started": bool}`, or `refused` (`browser.start-firefox` is off), `failed` (Firefox could not start, for example with no graphical session; `error` says why), `timeout` (Firefox did not connect in time) or `cancelled` (`kill`).

## 5. Device side

- `talaria run` with `browser.enabled: true` listens on `<state dir>/browser.sock` (the state directory is `store.state-dir`, by default `talaria` in the user config directory). The directory is made mode 0700 and the socket 0600; on Linux it also checks the peer's uid with `SO_PEERCRED` and refuses other users. `browser.allow-hosts` lists loopback or private network host names the agent may open (section 6).
- `talaria browser install` (alias `install-host`) writes, for the current user and without root, the host manifest `talaria.json` (`"allowed_extensions": ["browser@hermes-device"]`, `"path"` = the running binary with symlinks resolved) and `talaria.socket` (the socket path for the configured state directory) into `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts` (Linux) or `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts` (macOS). Run it again after moving the binary or changing `store.state-dir`. `talaria browser uninstall` removes both files, and the `hermes_device.json` and `hermes_device.socket` of releases before the rename. Extension versions before the rename connect to the host `hermes_device`; the current extension tries `talaria` first, then `hermes_device`, and the migration keeps a `hermes_device` manifest that points at the talaria binary (README, Renamed from hermes-device).
- `browser.autologin-hosts` lists the exact hosts where `browser_login` may submit the login form that Firefox fills from its saved logins (section 7.4); the plugin cannot change this list.
- `browser.start-firefox` (default true) lets the agent start Firefox (section 5.1). `browser.headless` (default false; the sandbox image turns it on) runs a Firefox of the daemon's own with no display (section 5.2), and `browser.profile-dir` is where it keeps its profile. `browser.firefox-command` (default `firefox`) is the command. `browser.confirm-hosts` adds sites where every click and every Enter or Space key press asks the user each time and scripts may only read (section 7.1); the plugin cannot change this list.
- `talaria browser extension --out <dir>` writes the extension's files, which the binary embeds, for loading as a temporary add-on.
- Firefox starts the binary as `<binary> <manifest path> <extension id>`. `main` recognizes that form, checks the extension id, finds the socket (`TALARIA_BROWSER_SOCKET`, else the path in the `.socket` file named like the manifest next to it (`talaria.socket` or `hermes_device.socket`), else the default state directory), dials it and sends `host_hello` with the extension id and its pid. Then it copies native messaging frames both ways and enforces Firefox's 1 MiB limit towards the browser.
- The extension sends `hello` (its version and the browser's name and version). The broker answers with `config` (`allow_hosts`, `confirm_hosts`, `hub_url`, the daemon's `hub.url`, which agent tabs may not open, and `device_id`, this device's hub id once the exec leg connected; the broker sends `config` again when the id arrives). The broker accepts one extension connection; a newer one replaces the older, and the older gets `replaced` first. An extension that was replaced does not reconnect on its own; opening its toolbar popup makes it take over again. So two Firefox instances with the extension no longer take turns.
- Wire format on the socket: native messaging frames (32-bit little-endian length, then JSON). Requests are `{"type": "request", "id", "op", "args"}`, answers `{"type": "response", "id", "ok", "result" | "error", "code"}`.

### 5.1 Starting Firefox

A scheduled job must work after the user closed Firefox. When the extension is not connected and the device offers it (`can_start`), any browser tool except `browser_status` sends `browser_start` first and then answers `started` ("Firefox was not running on device X, so it was started and is connected now. Make the same browser call again."). The call is not run in the same step, so its approvals are asked against the running browser. `browser_status` only reports that Firefox is not running. The tools stay listed while Firefox is closed and the device can start it.

The daemon usually runs as a systemd user service, which has no display variables. To start Firefox in the user's graphical session it:

1. Takes its own environment. When that has neither `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` nor `DISPLAY`, it adds the session variables (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, `XAUTHORITY`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` and a few more) from `systemctl --user show-environment`. Desktops import them into the user manager at login (measured on this project's KDE Plasma desktop: the user manager has `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, `XAUTHORITY` and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, the service's own environment does not). `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` defaults to `/run/user/<uid>` and the bus to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus` when they exist.
2. Checks that the display's socket exists (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, or `/tmp/.X11-unix/X<n>` for `:<n>`). If there is no display, or its socket is gone (the user logged out), it fails with "no graphical session" and says to sign in to the desktop.
3. Runs `systemd-run --user --scope --collect --unit=app-hermes-firefox-<random>.scope -- <firefox>` (plain `<firefox>` without systemd), in a new session, with standard streams on `/dev/null`. The scope keeps Firefox out of the daemon's cgroup, so restarting `talaria run` does not stop Firefox. Without `-P` or `--profile` Firefox opens the user's default profile, where the extension and the user's logins are. When Firefox already runs, the command opens a window there and exits. On macOS it runs `open -a Firefox`.
4. Starts Firefox at most once a minute (a second `browser_start` within a minute is refused), then waits until the extension connects, at most 90 seconds.

### 5.2 Headless Firefox (the sandbox)

The sandbox has no desktop, so `ghcr.io/usa-reddragon/talaria-sandbox` carries its own Firefox and runs it headless. The image sets `TALARIA_BROWSER_ENABLED=true`, `TALARIA_BROWSER_HEADLESS=true` and `TALARIA_BROWSER_FIREFOX_COMMAND=firefox-esr`. It is Alpine's `firefox-esr` (140 ESR: tab groups need Firefox 139) with `font-dejavu`: the image grows from 454 MB to 848 MB unpacked (175 MB to 332 MB compressed, measured on amd64); Alpine builds it for amd64, arm64 and armv7. With `browser.headless`, `talaria run`:

1. Registers its own binary as the native messaging host in `$HOME/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts`, with the browser socket path next to it, as `talaria browser install` does.
2. Writes the profile in `browser.profile-dir` (default `firefox-profile` in the state directory, on the `/work` volume, so cookies and logins that the agent gives this browser survive a pod restart). Each start it replaces `extensions/browser@hermes-device/` with the extension embedded in the binary (so the extension always matches the daemon), writes `user.js` (extension signature check off, which Alpine's ESR build honors; no add-on, browser or telemetry updates; no first-run pages), and removes stale lock files. Nothing else in the profile is touched.
3. Starts `firefox-esr --headless --no-remote --profile <dir>` in a process group of its own, with the commands' environment (no device token), and starts it again, after 2 s doubling to 1 minute, when it exits. `browser_start` wakes the supervisor and the usual wait for the extension applies. On shutdown Firefox gets SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 10 s. Its output is in `firefox.log` next to the profile.

Everything after the extension connects is the same as on a computer: the same extension, the same broker and protocol, the same approvals, the same tab group and tab cleanup. The profile is the sandbox's own; the sandbox cannot reach the user's computers or their Firefox, and the user's logins are never in it. The agent's own commands run in the same container and can read this profile, as they can read everything on `/work`. Firefox's content sandbox runs under the pod's default seccomp profile (measured: it starts with no capabilities, a read-only root filesystem and docker's default seccomp profile). Pages load over the pod's egress policy, which for the sandbox is the internet and DNS and nothing on the LAN, so the extension's private-address block (section 6) has nothing to add there.

`internal/browser/sandboxtest` starts the image and drives it over the exec leg as the plugin does (`TALARIA_SANDBOX_IMAGE=<image> go test ./internal/browser/sandboxtest/`): it waits for the extension, opens `https://example.com/`, takes a snapshot and a screenshot, and closes the tab.

Not tested end to end: the test suite does not start a Firefox on the user's display. The environment, the command line and the device's `browser_start` handling have unit tests.

## 6. Extension

- Manifest V2 with a persistent background page. Firefox keeps Manifest V2 supported, and a persistent page keeps the native port open. Manifest V3 in Firefox makes host permissions optional at install, which `tabs.captureTab` needs (inference; check before moving).
- Permissions: `nativeMessaging`, `tabs`, `tabGroups`, `scripting`, `webRequest`, `webRequestBlocking`, `dns`, `<all_urls>`. Firefox shows these at install. The extension keeps nothing in `storage` and needs no `identity`.
- The toolbar button's title and badge show whether the extension is connected to talaria ("Talaria: connected", a green badge "on") or not, and the operation while one runs. The button opens the page chat (section 6.2). After another Firefox took over, opening it makes this one take over again.
- Agent tabs may not open the daemon's hub (`hub_url` from `config`, matched by host and port), so the agent cannot use the user's hub session, for example to pair another computer or remove one.
- No content scripts are registered, nothing listens for page messages, and there is no `externally_connectable` or web accessible resource. Page code runs only through `scripting.executeScript` during an operation, in the isolated world, in one frame or in all frames of the tab, and through `tabs.executeScript` when the open page chat reads the active tab's selected text. Agent scripts (`eval`) run through `tabs.executeScript` with `code` in the same isolated world (section 7.2). No new permission was needed for frames, keys or scripts, so updating the extension asks the user nothing.
- It acts only on tabs that are in its tab group now (tabs it opened, and tabs the user moved in; a tab dragged out is no longer the agent's). Anything else gets `refused`. The one exception: `read_text` and `snapshot` for the session of a page chat that granted the tab (section 6.2). Firefox puts tabs opened from a grouped tab (a link with a target, `window.open`, the user's middle click) into the same group (source, `Tabbrowser.sys.mjs`), so those become agent tabs too. Planned: count only tabs the agent opened or the user granted with a context menu item, since another extension can also move tabs into the group.
- It reads, snapshots and screenshots only tabs that show an `http` or `https` page, so going back or redirecting to `file:` or `about:` does not expose those pages. Measured: `read_text` on a user's tab is refused, and so is `navigate` to `file:`.
- It blocks every request from an agent tab (navigations, redirects, links, forms, subresources, WebSockets) to loopback, RFC 1918, link-local, CGNAT (100.64/10, which Tailscale uses), unique-local IPv6 and `.local`, `.localhost`, `.internal` and `.home.arpa` names, unless the host is in `browser.allow-hosts`. Host names are resolved with `dns.resolve`, so public names that point at private addresses are also caught. Without this, an injected instruction could use the user's browser against local services, such as a router or Hermes's own loopback-trusted web server. This needs the `webRequest`, `webRequestBlocking` and `dns` permissions. A name the resolver cannot resolve is blocked. IPv4-mapped and NAT64 IPv6 literals are checked as the IPv4 address they hold (measured: `http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/` is refused). DNS rebinding between the check and the connection is still possible (inference). Requests a page's service worker makes have no tab (`tabId` -1) and are not checked (suspected; not tested). `tab_open` puts the tab in the group while it is still blank, so the first request is checked.
- It navigates only to `http` and `https` URLs. `about:`, `file:` and `moz-extension:` are out of reach, and Firefox itself keeps extensions off the domains in `extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains` (addons.mozilla.org, accounts.firefox.com and others; source, `greprefs.js`).
- It checks a `guard` right before each click and type, in the page (section 7).

### 6.1 Loading and signing

Release and Beta Firefox install only add-ons that Mozilla signed; `xpinstall.signatures.required` has no effect there (Mozilla's documentation; not tested here). Each release tag publishes the extension signed by addons.mozilla.org (AMO) as a self-distributed ("unlisted") add-on. It is not listed on AMO.

`talaria setup` opens Firefox at the `.xpi` of the release that matches the binary (the latest release for a development build) when no Firefox profile has the extension, and GitHub serves the file as `application/x-xpinstall`, so Firefox offers to install it (measured: the content type; the Firefox prompt is an inference, not tested). To install it by hand:

1. Open the latest release at https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/talaria/releases/latest and download `talaria-firefox-<version>.xpi`. Its version can be older than the release's own: the extension is bumped only when it changes (the v0.25.3 release has `talaria-firefox-0.24.0.xpi`), and the daemon and the extension are compatible across such releases.
2. In Firefox, open `about:addons`, choose the gear menu, then "Install Add-on From File...", and pick the file. You can also drag the file onto a Firefox window.

Updates: the manifest's `browser_specific_settings.gecko.update_url` is `https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/talaria/releases/latest/download/updates.json`. Firefox checks it about once a day (the default `extensions.update.interval`) and installs a newer version from the `update_link` in that file, after it checks the file's `update_hash` (SHA-256). GitHub answers that URL with a redirect to the latest release's asset. Firefox follows redirects for update manifests: `AddonUpdateChecker.sys.mjs` loads the manifest with an XHR and its `CertUtils.BadCertHandler` lets every redirect through, after a certificate check when `extensions.update.requireBuiltInCerts` is on (source, mozilla-firefox `toolkit/mozapps/extensions/internal/AddonUpdateChecker.sys.mjs` and `toolkit/modules/CertUtils.sys.mjs`; not yet tested with a real update). To check now, choose "Check for Updates" in the gear menu of `about:addons`.

What the Release workflow does (`.github/workflows/release.yaml`, job `firefox-extension`, after GoReleaser published the release):

1. It builds the extension with `talaria browser extension --out DIR --ext-version X`, where X is the tag without its leading `v`. Only the `version` line differs from the files in `extension/firefox`.
2. It runs `web-ext lint`, the same validator AMO runs, so problems show in the job log. The Tests workflow runs the same lint on every push.
3. It compares the extension with the one signed for the newest earlier release that has an `updates.json`. When only the `version` differs, it uploads that release's `updates.json` and its signed `.xpi` (under the name it was signed as) to this release and skips AMO: Firefox stays on the signed file of the earlier release, and AMO, which limits how many versions an account can submit per day, is not asked again. `talaria setup` follows `updates.json` to that file.
4. Otherwise it signs with `web-ext sign --channel unlisted`, with the repository secrets `AMO_JWT_ISSUER` and `AMO_JWT_SECRET`.
5. It checks that the signed file has a Mozilla signature and the expected version, then uploads `talaria-firefox-<version>.xpi` and `updates.json` to the release.
6. It rewrites `talaria_<version>_checksums.txt` over every archive and `.xpi`, and uploads the same file as `hermes-device_<version>_checksums.txt` for `talaria update` of older installs.

The job skips signing, with a notice in its log, and the release then has no `.xpi` and no `updates.json`, when:

- The secrets are not set (forks, or before they are added). The binaries and images are still released.
- The tag is a pre-release or has build metadata (`v1.2.0-rc.1`). Firefox versions are one to four dot-separated numbers, and no such number for `1.2.0-rc.1` sorts before `1.2.0`.
- The release already has `updates.json` (a re-run). AMO accepts each version only once.

While the latest release has no `updates.json`, Firefox's update check fails quietly and the installed version stays. The next signed release fixes that.

One-time setup for the maintainer:

1. Sign in at https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/api/key/ and accept the developer agreement. Generate credentials. The JWT issuer looks like `user:12345:67`.
2. In a clone of the repository, run `gh secret set AMO_JWT_ISSUER` and `gh secret set AMO_JWT_SECRET`, and paste each value at the prompt.
3. Tag a release. The first upload creates the add-on on AMO under the id `browser@hermes-device`. That id stays fixed: the host manifest's `allowed_extensions` names it.

AMO runs automated validation. Unlisted add-ons are signed without a review by hand, but Mozilla may review them later (Mozilla's Extension Workshop documentation). AMO requires a new `version` for every upload, and `data_collection_permissions` in the manifest (present: `"required": ["none"]`). The extension has no minified or generated code, so no source code upload is needed.

For development, load the extension as a temporary add-on instead:

1. `talaria browser extension --out ~/hermes-browser-extension`. A release binary writes its own version into the manifest; `--ext-version` sets another.
2. In Firefox, open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, choose "Load Temporary Add-on..." and pick `manifest.json` in that directory.

A temporary add-on stays until Firefox restarts. While it is loaded, it takes the place of an installed add-on with the same id (inference from Mozilla's documentation; not tested). Firefox Developer Edition, Nightly and ESR can instead set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false and install an unsigned `.xpi` permanently (inference from Mozilla's documentation; not tested).

### 6.2 Page chat

The toolbar button opens a popup (24rem by 32rem), and the popup can move to the Firefox sidebar and back. Both show `pagechat.html`, which frames the hub's page chat view, `<hub.url>/pagechat`. The hub serves that view from its own files (the same scripts and styles as the hub), so the page chat and the hub cannot drift, and a hub release changes the page chat without an extension release.

Why a frame, and not the hub's files in the extension (measured on Firefox 157.0.1, Linux, with a fresh profile, so Total Cookie Protection was on: `network.cookie.cookieBehavior` 5):

- A frame of the hub in an extension page gets the hub's first-party cookies. The extension has host permission for the hub (`<all_urls>`), and Firefox treats such a frame as same-site: the hub saw `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` and its `SameSite=Lax` `__Host-` session cookie on the frame, a GET and a POST from it, and the POST's `Origin` was the hub's own. The same frame in an ordinary page of another site got no cookie. So the user's hub sign-in works in the page chat with no new sign-in, and the hub's own CSRF and origin checks stay as they are.
- The hub's files bundled into the extension would run in the extension's origin: every API call would come from a `moz-extension:` origin, which the hub refuses, and the bundled copy would lag the hub until the next extension release. addons.mozilla.org also requires that extension code ship in the package; a framed web page is web content, not extension code, and gets no extension API.
- The hub allows the frame only on `/pagechat`: `frame-ancestors 'self' moz-extension:`. Every other hub page keeps `frame-ancestors 'none'`.

The frame and `pagechat.html` talk over a `MessagePort` that `pagechat.html` sends to the hub's origin after each load. Over it the view asks for the window's tabs and the selection, and reports where three buttons are. Those three buttons (move to the sidebar, move back to the popup, close the sidebar) call `sidebarAction.open`, `browserAction.openPopup` and `sidebarAction.close`, which Firefox runs only during a click in the extension page itself (source: `requireUserInput` in `sidebar_action.json`, and `ExtensionChild.sys.mjs`, which checks `windowUtils.isHandlingUserInput` of the calling page; a click in the frame does not count). So `pagechat.html` lays transparent buttons with the same labels over them and tells the view when the pointer is over one.

Before each message, the view asks `pagechat.html` for the context of the chat's session: the `http` and `https` tabs of the window (at most 50, without the hub's own tabs), or only the active tab when the user picked "This tab only", and the active tab's selected text (at most 4000 characters). `pagechat.html` asks the background page to grant those tabs to that session, and the hub adds them to the message (hub README, Page chat). A grant:

- lets `read_text` and `snapshot` requests whose `sessions` include that session read those tabs, as for agent tabs. Every other operation on them is refused as before;
- replaces the session's previous grant, and ends 30 minutes after the message;
- lives only in the background page's memory, so it ends when Firefox or the extension restarts;
- is accepted only from the extension's own `pagechat.html` (the sender check in `runtime.onMessage`).

Measured in the end-to-end test (`internal/browser/firefoxtest/pagechat_test.go`): a granted tab outside the group is readable with its session (also as an ancestor in `sessions`) and refused with another session or none, a click on it is refused, and a "This tab only" grant leaves out the other tabs.

## 7. Permission and confirmation model

The agent acts with the user's logins, so a page's text is untrusted input to the model (prompt injection), and some actions cannot be undone.

| Action | Default |
|---|---|
| Snapshot, read text, screenshot, back, list or close tabs | Allowed |
| Click or type that does not submit and does not leave the site | Allowed |
| Open a site the session did not use yet: `browser_navigate` or `browser_tabs` `open` to another host than the tab's, or a click on a link to another host | Ask once per site per session (`rule_key` `browser:visit:<site>`) |
| Submit a form: a click on a submit control, or `browser_type` with `submit` | Ask once per site per session (`rule_key` `browser:submit:<site>`, the site of the form's action) |
| Any click or type on a page with a password, payment or one-time code field in any frame | Ask every time |
| Key press (`browser_press`): Enter or Space on a submit control or Enter in a form field | As a submit |
| Hover, scroll, wait | Allowed |
| Run a read-only script (`browser_eval`) on a site | Ask once per site per session (`rule_key` `browser:script:<site>`, the site of the frame it runs in) |
| Run a script that changes data (`browser_eval` with `allow_writes`) | Ask once per site per session (`rule_key` `browser:script-write:<site>`); covers read-only scripts there too |
| Any click, Enter or Space key press, or `browser_type` with `submit` on Salesforce (section 7.1) | Ask once per host per session (`rule_key` `browser:click:<host>`, the exact host); "always" lets unattended runs click there |
| The same on a site in the device's `browser.confirm-hosts` (section 7.1) | Ask every time |
| A script that changes data on Salesforce | Refused; no approval can allow it |
| Any script on a page with a password, payment or one-time code field | Ask every time |
| Sign in with the login Firefox saved (`browser_login`) on a host in `browser.autologin-hosts` | Ask once per host (`rule_key` `browser:login:<host>`, the exact host); "always" lets unattended runs sign in (section 7.4) |
| Scripts on a host in `browser.autologin-hosts`; clicks, typing, key presses, screenshots and selector waits on its pages with a password field | Refused; no approval can allow it |
| Downloads, file uploads, permission prompts, browser dialogs | Not offered |

A site is the host name in lower case without a leading `www.`. It is not the registrable domain: `accounts.example.com` and `example.com` are separate sites. That asks more often, but an approval never covers a host the user did not see.

How the plugin asks:

1. Its `pre_tool_call` hook runs for `browser_batch` (which it checks step by step, section 3), `browser_navigate`, `browser_tabs`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_press`, `browser_eval` and `browser_login`. It first drops any grant left from an earlier call with the same arguments (one the user denied). For a click or type it sends `inspect` for the target ref; for a navigate or a new tab it sends `inspect` with the URL (and the tab), so the site it asks about is the host the browser itself parses from the URL, not the plugin's reading of it. When that `inspect` fails, it asks about the raw URL and approves no host, so the extension refuses to open another site. `inspect` returns the page's host, the kinds of secret fields on the page (`sensitive`: `password` for `type=password` or a password `autocomplete`; `payment` for `cc-*` `autocomplete`, card, CVC or expiry field names, or an iframe of a known payment provider; `one_time_code` for `autocomplete="one-time-code"` or OTP, 2FA or verification code field names) and what the ref is (`submit` with the host of the button's `formaction` or its form's action, for a submit button around the ref, a label's control, or a button outside its form through `form=`; else `link` with its host; `field`; or `other`).
2. For a submit or a new site it returns `{"action": "approve", "message": ..., "rule_key": ...}`. Hermes sends that to its approval gate, which asks wherever the user talks to the agent (CLI prompt, web UI, Telegram buttons, the ACP editor) and offers once, session, always and deny. "Session" remembers the rule key for the session and "always" for good, in `command_allowlist` (source, `hermes_cli/plugins.py:1987-2016`, `tools/approval.py:996-1068`, `412-425`). The gate approves at once in yolo mode or with `approvals.mode: off`, and denies when no human can answer (cron, `-q`, webhooks) unless `approvals.cron_mode`, `single_query_mode` or `unattended_mode` say approve.
3. On a page with secret fields the hook asks nothing. The handler calls `request_elicitation_consent` (source, `tools/approval_prompt.py:296-376`) without a `remember_key`, so the user can only allow this one call or deny it. Yolo and `approvals.mode: off` do not skip it, and it denies when no human can answer.
4. The hook hands the handler what was approved, and the handler sends it as the `guard` of the `click`, `type`, `navigate` or `tab_open`. The extension classifies the element and the page again in the page before it acts, and again after the synthetic pointer and mouse events and right before the activation (page handlers of those events can rewrite links and forms). It refuses (`refused`) a submit to a host not in `submit_hosts`, a link or navigation to another site not in `visit_hosts`, and any action on a page with secret fields without `sensitive`. So a page that changed between the hook and the action cannot slip a submit, a new site or a secret field past the user, and a handler call without the hook (or after a failed `inspect`) can do only what needs no approval.

The hook's `inspect` runs inside Hermes's hook timeout (`plugins.hook_callback_timeout`, default 30 seconds). A hook call past that timeout makes Hermes block every tool call the hook sees, in every session, until the call ends and for 60 seconds after, so the hook's whole wait for `inspect` (the device's timeout and the slack after it) is at most half of the hook timeout and at most 25 seconds: 15 seconds with the default. When it fails, a navigate still asks, and a click or type goes ahead with an empty guard.

Known gaps:

- Navigation that a page starts by itself after a click (a script that sets `location`, a redirect, a `target` link) is not classified. The extension's private network block still applies to requests from agent tabs.
- Script-driven submits are not seen: a `type=button` or `role=button` control that posts with `fetch`, as most single-page apps do, counts as a plain click and needs no approval. Only a page with secret fields then asks.
- Sensitive field detection is heuristic. It covers every frame and shadow tree the extension can reach.
- Planned: the user's block list (banks, the password manager) in the device config, so a compromised pod cannot remove it.

### 7.1 Salesforce (protected sites)

On Salesforce every click needs the user's approval of the host. A site is protected when its host is, or ends in `.` and, one of `force.com`, `salesforce.com`, `visualforce.com`, `cloudforce.com`, `salesforce-setup.com`, `salesforce-sites.com`, `documentforce.com` and `force-user-content.com` (Salesforce's own domains for Lightning, My Domain, Visualforce, Setup, Sites and files), or one of the device's `browser.confirm-hosts` (with its subdomains). The check uses the tab's host and the host of the frame the action runs in. Experience Cloud sites on `*.my.site.com` and customer domains are not covered by default; add them to `browser.confirm-hosts`.

On a protected site:

- On a Salesforce host, `browser_click`, `browser_press` with Enter or Space, and `browser_type` with `submit` go through the normal approval gate (section 7, point 2) with the rule key `browser:click:<host>` (the exact host) and the element's text in the question ("The agent wants to click the element "Start Session Timer" on ... (Salesforce)"). The user answers once, this chat, always or deny. "Always" (or `plugin_rule:browser:click:<host>` in `command_allowlist`) lets scheduled runs click there, for example in a report's filter panel (section 7.3). Yolo and `approvals.mode: off` approve it like the other rules.
- On a site in the device's `browser.confirm-hosts`, the same calls ask every time: the handler asks through `request_elicitation_consent` without a remember key, so the user can only allow this one call or deny it. No "session" or "always" answer and no `command_allowlist` entry covers it, and yolo and `approvals.mode: off` do not skip it. With no user present (section 7.3) such a call fails at once.
- On a page with password, payment or one-time code fields, every click asks every time on every site, Salesforce included (section 7, point 3).
- Typing without submit, other keys (Tab, Escape, arrows), hover, scroll, snapshots, text and screenshots need nothing more than on other sites.
- `browser_eval` with `allow_writes` is refused by the plugin and by the extension. Read-only scripts use the normal approval (`browser:script:<site>`, "always" allowed), so a scheduled job can read. A read-only script cannot send anything but GET and HEAD requests to the site (section 7.2).

The extension enforces the same list (the plugin's and the device config's): it refuses a click, an activating key press or a submit on a protected site without `guard.confirmed`, and every script with `allow_writes`.

### 7.2 Scripts (browser_eval)

`browser_eval` runs agent JavaScript in an agent tab, as the body of an async function, and returns the value it returns, as JSON. Only the agent's tool call starts it: the op comes over native messaging from the daemon, and pages have no way to reach the extension (section 8).

Where it runs: in the extension's isolated content script world of the frame, through `tabs.executeScript` with `code`, which the page's Content Security Policy does not block. It sees the page's DOM, not the page's JavaScript objects. `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` in the script are the page's own (`content.fetch`, `content.XMLHttpRequest`), so requests go out as the page's, with its cookies, origin and same-origin rules, as a script in the developer console would (measured: a GET of a local JSON API returns its value, and an approved PUT reaches the server with its headers and body). Values put on `window` stay for later scripts in the same page (measured). Before agent code runs, the extension API (`browser`, `chrome`) is removed from that world, so a script cannot read the hub credential in `storage.local` or message the extension (measured: `typeof browser` is "undefined", also through `globalThis`, and `browser.storage` cannot be reached); the extension's helpers keep only `runtime.getFrameId`. Same-origin frames' documents are reachable from the script (measured: `iframe.contentDocument`), cross-origin ones are not.

Approval: the site of the frame the script runs in (section 7 table). The question shows the first 400 characters of the script. A script in a cross-origin frame needs that frame's site (measured: refused with only the page's approval).

Limits the extension sets before the script runs, kept until the agent loads a page in the tab again with `browser_navigate`. That navigation first loads `about:blank` (no request), so the page that ran the script is gone before the limits end, and the new page loads without them:

- Requests from the tab may go only to the sites of the page and of the frame the script ran in. Everything else is cancelled: the page's fetch, images, beacons, script-driven navigations, and tabs the page opens (they inherit the limits). Requests from content scripts with the extension's own `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` carry no tab and no origin (measured: `tabId` -1, no `originUrl`); while any tab holds limits, all such requests are cancelled (measured: none of seven ways to reach another site from a script got through). This also cancels such requests of other extensions while a tab that ran a script is open.
- A read-only script (no `allow_writes`): the tab may send only GET and HEAD requests and may not open WebSockets (measured: a PUT fails with NetworkError and the server gets nothing). This covers what the script does through the page too, such as clicking a button whose handler posts. The page's own writes are cancelled as well until the next navigation, so a Salesforce page that ran a read-only script stops saving anything.
- Writes are tracked per site: a script with `allow_writes` lifts the read-only limit only for the site the user approved writes on. Every other site in the tab's list (the top page's, another frame's) stays read-only (measured: after an approved write on the page, a POST to a frame's site is refused).
- A script in a frame of a tab that already ran a script is refused until the next navigation, and the top frame's address is taken from the browser, not from the page's world, because an earlier script could have changed what that world reports.
- A tab opened from another tab (it has an opener) may not run scripts, since a script could navigate its opener, which has no limits. Agent tabs that `browser_navigate` opens have no opener.
- Scripts with `allow_writes` are refused on pages with password, payment or one-time code fields; read-only scripts there ask every time.
- Clicks, typing and key presses are refused in the tab, because the script could have changed the extension's helpers in that world. Scroll, hover, snapshots, text and screenshots still work.
- `browser_back` is refused in a tab that ever ran a script, so a page that ran agent code is not restored from the history cache without its limits.

Writes and "always": `browser:script-write:<site>` is a separate approval, so the user grants it knowingly. "Always" for `browser:script:<site>` covers only read-only scripts; "always" for `browser:script-write:<site>` covers writes and reads there. Both are entries `plugin_rule:browser:script:<site>` and `plugin_rule:browser:script-write:<site>` in Hermes's `command_allowlist`; remove the entry (Hermes picks up the change at once) to revoke it.

Known gaps:

- The page's own code can see and change what the script does on the page (it shares the DOM, and the page's `fetch` can be replaced by the page). Approve scripts only on sites you trust.
- The script can read anything the page can, including cookies that are not HttpOnly, and returns it to the agent.
- A GET can change data on a badly built site; read-only means only GET and HEAD.
- Requests a page's service worker makes have no tab and an origin, so the limits do not cover them (suspected; not tested). A WebSocket the page opened before the script stays open.
- A page that a script ran in can still be restored from the history cache by a page that calls `history.back()` itself after the agent navigated.
- Pages a script opens with `noopener` may get no opener id and then no limits; Firefox's popup blocker usually stops `window.open` from a script (inference; not tested).
- The block on requests from the extension's own `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` rests on how Firefox 157 reports them (no tab, no origin). If a later Firefox sets an origin there, scripts could reach other sites through them; the end-to-end test checks it on every run.
- Yolo mode and `approvals.mode: off` approve every `browser:visit`, `browser:submit`, `browser:script` and `browser:script-write` rule at once in an attended session (Hermes's gate); only the per-call confirmations (secret fields, `browser.confirm-hosts`) still ask.
- Firefox add-on policies restrict running code that is not part of the add-on. These scripts are the user's agent's tool calls, not code the add-on loads, but AMO's reviewers may judge otherwise (inference; the add-on is unlisted and signed without a manual review today).

### 7.3 Runs with no user present

A scheduled job (cron), a one-shot query (`-q`) or a webhook session has no user to answer. The plugin checks this with Hermes's own test (`tools.approval_context._no_user_can_answer`) before it asks:

- An approval kind the user granted before ("always", or "session" in the same session) counts as granted, through Hermes's `tools.approval.is_approved` for `plugin_rule:<rule_key>`. The call then runs with no prompt.
- Anything else is blocked at once, in `pre_tool_call`, with a message that names the rule (`plugin_rule:browser:visit:<site>` and so on) and says the user must grant it once with "always" or add it to `command_allowlist`. This holds whatever `approvals.cron_mode` says: browser approvals are not granted by default in an unattended run.
- Actions that ask every time (pages with secret fields, clicks on a site in `browser.confirm-hosts`) are blocked at once with a message that they need the user each time. Clicks on Salesforce run when the user granted `browser:click:<host>` with "always".

To prepare a scheduled job: run it once in a chat and answer "always" for each site and kind it needs, or add the `plugin_rule:browser:...` entries to `command_allowlist` in the Hermes config. A config managed in git keeps them across rebuilds. Create the job in a chat whose browser device (section 3.2) is the computer the job should use, or set it later with `browser_use_device` and `job_id`. The job's commands run in the sandbox; only its browser calls go to that computer, which starts Firefox when it is closed (section 5.1). A job with no browser device uses the sandbox's own Firefox (section 5.2).

Section 7.4 is the one exception to the block on pages with password fields: `browser_login` on a host in `browser.autologin-hosts` runs unattended once the user granted `browser:login:<host>` with "always".

The user can stop everything at any time: close the Talaria tab group, disable the extension, stop `talaria run`, or remove the computer under Settings, Computers on the hub.

### 7.4 Saved logins (browser_login)

A scheduled job can need to sign in, for example when a session cookie expired overnight. `browser_login` lets Firefox's own saved login do it: Firefox fills the form, the extension submits it, and the agent never sees, types or reads the password.

Why this way (source, Firefox 157 `LoginManagerChild.sys.mjs`, about lines 1677 to 1781): no WebExtension can start another extension's fill or Firefox's saved-login menu (those need trusted user events). What works with no user is Firefox's page-load autofill. Firefox fills a login form by itself when the page is https, the form is in the top frame or a same-origin frame, exactly one login is saved for the origin, `signon.autofillForms` is true (the default), no primary password is locked, and the document is visible (`document.visibilityState` is `visible`) and loaded (`readyState` is `complete`). In a background tab it waits until the tab is shown, so showing the tab is enough; no reload is needed. Agent tabs open in the background (`tab_open` uses `active: false`), so `browser_login` shows the tab first. Measured in the end-to-end test: a tab opened in the background with one saved login is filled once `browser_login` shows it, and the filled field matches `:autofill`; with two saved logins for the origin Firefox fills nothing.

Configuration: `browser.autologin-hosts` in the device config lists exact host names, empty by default. No subdomains are covered and the plugin cannot change the list. List only dedicated sign-in hosts (identity providers): `login` submits any simple username and password form on a listed host, and a cross-site scripting hole on a listed host would expose the password. Example, for IBM's w3id password page ("Sign in with your w3id password", public, on `login.w3.ibm.com`):

```yaml
browser:
  autologin-hosts: [login.w3.ibm.com]
```

The user must save exactly one login for that host in the Firefox profile the extension runs in, with no primary password, or one that is unlocked. Use `browser_login` with the `tab_id` of the tab the application redirected to the sign-in page. Opening the w3id page directly does not work: without the application's parameters it shows an error page, not a form (seen by the review with a plain HTTP fetch, no cookies).

Scope of the guarantee: the agent cannot get the password through the browser tools. It does not hold against code that runs as the user on the computer: with no primary password, any program of the user can decrypt `logins.json` with `key4.db` from the profile, and can edit the device config. The exec leg runs commands as the user (protocol.md section 4), so a device that also serves commands to the pod gives a compromised pod, or an agent that gets a command approved, that path. Where that matters, use a browser-only device, or run Firefox as another OS user.

What `login` does, in the extension:

1. It takes the tab's host from `tabs.get`, never from the page. The tab must show an https page on a host in the list, and `guard.login_hosts` must name that host. With `url` it opens the page in a new agent tab first, only for an https URL on an approved host in the list (this needs no `browser:visit` approval). It refuses a tab that ran a script and has not loaded a page since (section 7.2).
2. In the top frame, with a self-contained page function that uses none of the helpers an earlier script could have changed, it finds the visible password fields. It needs exactly one, not marked `autocomplete="new-password"`, and a username field, else it answers `filled: false` with a reason. So a form that asks only for the password again (to confirm an action) is not submitted. The username field is the field marked `autocomplete="username"` or `email`, else the nearest text or email field before the password field in its form.
3. It shows the tab (and restores its window when it is minimized) and checks every 250 ms, up to `timeout_ms`, whether the password field and the username field are non-empty. Only yes or no leaves the page, never a value or a length.
4. When the fields stay empty it answers `filled: false` and a `reason`: the tab did not become visible, or Firefox did not fill the form (no saved login for the host, more than one saved login, a locked primary password, or autofill turned off). The extension cannot tell these apart: WebExtensions have no API that reads saved logins.
5. When they are filled it checks in the page, right before the submit, that the page's host is still the tab's host and in the list, that the form's action (or its submit button's `formaction`) is https on a host in the list, that the form posts (a GET form would put the password into the address), and that it does not target another tab or frame. It reads the form's `action`, `method`, `target` and `elements` through `HTMLFormElement.prototype`, so a field named `action` cannot stand in for them. Then it calls `form.requestSubmit()` with the first enabled submit button after the password field (else the form's first one). A page whose submit handler cancels the submit still gives `submitted: true`; `landed_host` then stays the sign-in host.
6. While it waits for the result, webRequest cancels any request from the tab that is not a GET or HEAD, unless it goes over https to a host in the list, until the first answer to a page load from a host in the list; and it cancels a 307 or 308 redirect of such a request to anything but https on a host in the list, since that would send the form's body again (measured: without that block, a 307 to another host gets the posted password). Later posts, such as a SAML response to the application, go through. The redirect rule stays for a minute after the op returns, for a post that is still pending.
7. It waits for the next page load (at most 30 seconds), then answers `{"tab_id", "filled": true, "submitted": true, "landed_host"}`: only the host of the page it landed on, not its address. Then it makes the previously active tab active again, and minimizes the window again, unless the user changed the active tab meanwhile.

Only one `login` runs at a time.

Approval: the plugin's `pre_tool_call` sends `inspect` and blocks at once when the host is not in the list. Else it asks with `rule_key` `browser:login:<host>` (exact host). "Always" lets scheduled jobs sign in; the rule covers nothing else on that host (visits, submits and scripts have their own rules). With no user present the call runs only when the rule was granted before (section 7.3).

Hardening on autologin hosts, enforced by the extension and also checked by the plugin:

- `browser_eval` is refused on a tab or frame whose host is in the list. No approval allows it. The injected script checks again, before the agent's code runs, that its document is on the approved site and not on a listed host, since the frame can load another page between the extension's checks and the injection.
- On every site, `browser_eval` is refused in a document with a filled password field, so a script cannot read a password Firefox filled. Clicks, typing and key presses on a listed host's login page check the host again in the page right before they act, and a screenshot is dropped when the tab shows such a page after the capture.
- On a page of such a host with a password field, `browser_click`, `browser_type` and `browser_press` are refused, so the agent cannot type into the password field or press a "show password" button. `browser_login` is the only action there. Hover, scrolling, snapshots and text still work.
- Snapshots show no field values at all on such hosts (elsewhere they omit only password, card and one-time code values), so a field whose type a page changed cannot show the password.
- Screenshots (`browser_vision`, `browser_screenshot`) and `browser_snapshot` waits with a CSS selector are refused on such a page with a password field. A screenshot of a filled password field shows one dot per character, which tells its length.
- `inspect` never uses a field's value as its `label`. This applies on every site: before, a text field's value could become the label, and the plugin puts the label into the Salesforce confirmation text.

Diagnostic: `browser_check` (op `check`) shows an agent tab for a moment (not a tab with a password field off the list, where Firefox would fill a saved login, and not while a `login` runs) and reports `document.visibilityState` before and after, whether the page has focus, the window state, and `would_fill` (the tab became visible), then restores the previously active tab. The daemon adds `screen_lock` from logind: `loginctl show-user <uid> -p Display` names the graphical session and `loginctl show-session <id> -p LockedHint` says whether it is locked (KDE Plasma and GNOME set it). On macOS, or without logind, `known` is false. Use it at night with the screen locked to see whether Firefox on Wayland still treats the shown tab as visible.

Known gaps:

- Whether Firefox fills while the screen is locked depends on whether it still reports the tab visible. That is not measured yet; `browser_check` tells.
- Showing the tab brings it to the front of its window for a few seconds, which a user at the computer sees.
- Firefox fills a same-origin frame too, but `browser_login` looks only at the top frame.
- A password field inside an `about:blank`, `srcdoc` or `blob:` frame of a listed page is not seen by the screenshot refusal, which could show its length.
- A page that signs in with script (`fetch`) instead of a form post works only when its submit handler runs on `requestSubmit`; the extension then waits up to 30 seconds for a page load.
- The site itself (the identity provider) receives the password, as it would from the user, and can redirect to any application after the sign-in.

## 8. Security analysis

Who can drive the browser:

- Only the agent of the hub user who owns the device, through that device's exec leg (section 13).
- Web pages: no. Native messaging is reachable only from the extension's privileged pages. The extension has no page-facing message channel. Content script refs are invisible to the page. The page chat's frame talks only to `pagechat.html`, over a port that page hands to the hub's origin; it cannot reach the background page or the host.
- Other users on the machine: no. The socket is 0600 in a 0700 directory, and the broker checks the peer uid on Linux. There is no TCP port.
- Other processes of the same user: yes, by connecting to the socket and pretending to be a host, or by editing the manifest. They can already read the Firefox profile and the device token, so this is not a new boundary. The broker accepts only `host_hello` for the expected extension id, which stops accidents, not attacks.
- Other extensions: no. Firefox starts the host only for ids in `allowed_extensions`, and the host checks the id again.
- Other extensions: they cannot talk to the host, but one with the `tabs` permission may be able to move a tab into the Hermes group and so hand it to the agent (suspected, not tested).
- The Hermes pod: yes, within the rules above. A compromised pod can do what the agent can: act in the Talaria tab group with the user's cookies, and read the tabs a page chat granted (section 6.2) for 30 minutes after the message, by naming that chat's session in `sessions`. It cannot read other tabs outside the group, cannot read `file:` or `about:` pages, and cannot reach loopback or private network hosts the device did not allow. This matches the exec leg, where a compromised pod can run commands in the device's roots.
- The hub: relays messages and cannot mint them except as the pod would (protocol.md section 10).
- The approvals in section 7 are decided by the plugin in the pod. A compromised pod can send any `guard`; the extension's checks stop mistakes and changed pages, not a hostile pod.

What the agent can see: the content of pages in its group, including whatever the user's cookies show there. Password field values are omitted from snapshots, but a screenshot shows what is on screen, including one dot per character of a filled password field (except on autologin hosts, where such screenshots are refused, section 7.4). Users should not move tabs with secrets into the group.

Prompt injection: page text reaches the model. The confirmation rules in section 7 and the scope rules above limit what an injected instruction can do. The plugin SHOULD wrap page text in a marked block that tells the model it is untrusted data.

## 9. Per platform

| Platform | Needs |
|---|---|
| Linux (X11 or Wayland) | A Firefox with the `tabs.group` API (measured on 157; the extension asks for 139 or later, which is an inference from Mozilla's release notes, not tested). Without the API the extension still works but shows no group. `talaria browser install` writes `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/talaria.json` (measured for the old name `hermes_device.json`: Firefox 157 reads it from `$HOME/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts`). The signed extension from a release (section 6.1). Nothing depends on the display server |
| Linux, Firefox as Snap | The Snap sandbox does not see host manifests in `~/.mozilla` by default and cannot run binaries outside the snap without the `native-messaging` portal (inference from Snap's confinement; not tested). Arch packages are not Snaps |
| Linux, Firefox as Flatpak | Same problem; needs the WebExtensions portal or a manual `--filesystem` override (inference; not tested) |
| macOS | Manifest in `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/` (the code handles it). No `SO_PEERCRED`: the socket's mode is the only check (it could use `LOCAL_PEERCRED`) |
| Windows | `talaria browser install` writes the manifest to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\talaria\native-messaging-hosts` and registers it under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\talaria`, where Firefox looks for it. Not yet tested with Firefox on Windows |

## 10. Code and tests

- `internal/browser/nativemsg`: native messaging framing.
- `internal/browser/broker`: the daemon's socket server and request calls.
- `internal/browser/host`: the native host relay and its manifest.
- `internal/browser/launch`: starting Firefox in the user's graphical session (section 5.1).
- `extension/firefox`: the extension (`manifest.json`, `background.js`), embedded in the binary. The `firefox-extension` job in `.github/workflows/release.yaml` signs and publishes it.
- `internal/device`: the `browser` capability, `browser`, `browser_result` and `browser_status` on the exec leg; `cmd/run.go` starts the broker when `browser.enabled` is on; `cmd/browser.go` is `talaria browser`.
- `plugin/device/browser.py`: the `device-browser` toolset and its `pre_tool_call` hook. `plugin/device/core.py` and `dashboard/plugin_api.py`: capability negotiation and browser calls on the exec leg.
- Unit tests: `internal/device/browser_test.go` (also `browser_start`), `internal/browser/*/..._test.go` (also the launch environment and command line), and `plugin/device/tests/test_browser.py` (the tools, the approvals, Salesforce, unattended runs, starting Firefox, hiding `browser_vault` and the negotiation with a fake device and browser, through a fresh Hermes `ToolRegistry`).
- `internal/browser/bidi` and `internal/browser/firefoxtest`: an end-to-end test that builds the binary, writes the host manifest into a fresh `HOME`, starts headless Firefox on a fresh profile with `--no-remote`, loads the extension as a temporary add-on over BiDi (`webExtension.install`; temporary add-ons skip signing), and drives it through the broker. When `hermes` is on `PATH` it then runs the real device client against the broker, with `plugin/device/tests/test_browser_e2e.py` on the other end of the exec leg in the Hermes runtime, and drives Firefox through the plugin's tools and approval hook.

Run the end-to-end test (it needs the network for example.com):

```sh
HERMES_BROWSER_E2E=1 go test -count=1 -v -run TestFirefoxEndToEnd ./internal/browser/firefoxtest/
```

It opens example.com in a new tab in the Hermes group, checks the title, the text, the snapshot and a PNG screenshot, checks that a link to another site is refused without approval and followed with it, fills a form on a local test server and checks that its submit is refused without approval and works with it, checks that opening a new site without approval is refused, checks the private network block (also for IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals) and the refusals, checks that a submit button inside a link and one outside its form are submits, checks that every action on a page with password and one-time code fields needs confirmation, and checks that an agent tab may not open the daemon's hub. `login_test.go` checks `browser_login` with real saved logins: the test starts Firefox with `--remote-allow-system-access`, and through BiDi's privileged browser window it trusts a test CA and saves logins with `Services.logins.addLoginAsync`, as Firefox does when a user saves one. The Remote Agent's recommended preferences turn `signon.autofillForms` off (measured: no fill without the override), so the test profile's `user.js` turns it on again. On https servers on 127.0.0.4 (in `browser.autologin-hosts`, one saved login), 127.0.0.5 (not in the list) and 127.0.0.6 (in the list, two saved logins) it checks: a host not in the list is refused; eval, typing into the password field, a click on a "show" button, a screenshot and a selector wait are refused on the login page; a login without approval is refused; the snapshot shows no values; `check` reports the tab hidden before and visible after it is shown and restores the active tab; a login on a background tab is filled by Firefox, submitted, and the server gets the saved password; a login from a URL; two saved logins give `filled: false` with the reason; a GET form is not submitted; a 307 redirect to another host does not get the post; a form with only a password field is not submitted; off the list, a script on a page with a filled password field is refused and `check` does not show a tab with a password field; and no answer or error holds the password. `frames_test.go` then checks, on local servers on 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2 and 127.0.0.3: a page with a same-origin and a cross-origin iframe and an open shadow root (snapshot, clicks in both frames and in the shadow tree, text of all of them, paged text), scrolling by page, to the bottom and to a text, key presses (a character, Tab, Escape, an unknown key), hover, waiting for late text and a selector, a full-page screenshot, and scripts: no approval, a GET fetch, state kept on `window`, a script without `return`, a script error, a PUT refused in a read-only script and without the write approval, an approved PUT that reaches the server, seven ways to reach another site from a script (none arrive), clicks and back refused after a script, a script in the cross-origin frame, and a protected site from `browser.confirm-hosts` (clicks and Enter refused without confirmation, Tab allowed, writes refused, reads allowed). The plugin part does the same through `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_vision`, `browser_click`, `browser_back`, `browser_type` and `browser_tabs`, and frames, keys, scrolling and scripts (a read, a write the hook did not approve, an approved write, and a blocked script with no user present) through `browser_snapshot`, `browser_press`, `browser_scroll` and `browser_eval`. BiDi is used only to install the unsigned extension in the test; the browser control itself goes through the extension.

## 11. Enable it

On the server: the device plugin of this release, with the toolset on (the default; `plugins.entries.device.settings.browser: false` turns it off). To hide Hermes's `browser_vault`, also set `plugins.entries.device.granted_capabilities: [tools.override]` (section 3.1). In a profile that also enables the camofox plugin, only one of the two gets the tool names.

On the computer, `talaria setup` does steps 1 to 5 (README, section Setup). By hand:

1. Set `browser.enabled: true` in the talaria config (and `browser.allow-hosts` for any LAN or loopback host the agent may open).
2. Run `talaria browser install` as the user who runs Firefox.
3. Restart `talaria run`.
4. Install the signed extension from a release (section 6.1).
   Its toolbar button shows "Talaria: connected" when it reaches the daemon.
5. Bind a session to this device with `/device <device> <dir>`. `browser_status` in that session shows whether the agent can use the browser.

## 12. Open risks

- The measurements come from a Firefox started with `--remote-debugging-port` (needed to load the unsigned extension in the test), which applies the Remote Agent's recommended preferences, among them the popup blocker off. Behavior in the user's own Firefox can differ, so the first manual test in a normal profile is still due.
- Synthetic input: `isTrusted` is false for every click and key. Sites that check it, canvas editors and some anti-bot flows will not work. Firefox gives WebExtensions no debugger API. If this blocks real use, the BiDi dynamic start mode (2.2) is the path, once Firefox ships it.
- Screenshots of background tabs: measured headless only. In a headed Firefox, `tabs.captureTab` of a tab that was never shown may return a blank or stale image (inference). The fix is to activate the tab in its own window briefly, or to open the Hermes group in a separate window.
- Signing: every release signs the extension on AMO (section 6.1). AMO validation rules can change and fail the signing step, and Mozilla may still review the unlisted add-on by hand.
- Snap and Flatpak Firefox (section 9).
- Scripts: the gaps in section 7.2, and the add-on policy question there.
- Starting Firefox is not tested end to end (section 5.1).
- Cancelled operations are not stopped in the browser (section 4.1).
- The approval rules have the gaps listed in section 7.
- Saved-login sign-in with the screen locked is not measured yet (section 7.4).
- A Firefox container for agent tabs would limit the agent to sites the user chose to sign in to there, which shrinks what a compromised pod or an injected instruction can reach. It costs the user one sign-in per site. Worth trying before release.
- The extension keeps its group and tab ids in memory: after a Firefox restart it creates a new Talaria group, and tabs in the old group are no longer the agent's.
- Any process of the user's OS account can drive the browser through the daemon's socket (section 13).

## 13. Trust model

The browser is authorized by the device, as commands are. There is no separate browser sign-in.

- The extension talks only to the local daemon, through native messaging. Firefox starts the native host only for the extension id in the host manifest's `allowed_extensions` (`browser@hermes-device`), and the host checks the id again.
- The native host reaches the daemon over `<state dir>/browser.sock`: mode 0600 in a 0700 directory, and on Linux the broker refuses a peer with another uid (`SO_PEERCRED`). So the socket, the daemon and the Firefox that uses it belong to one OS user. Another OS user on the same computer runs their own daemon, paired on its own.
- The daemon is paired to one hub user (`talaria login` or `setup`; the hub keeps the SHA-256 of its device token). The exec leg is the device's own connection, authenticated by that token, and the hub checks on every request, every upgrade and every `device.recheck_interval` that the device is not removed and that its user may still use the backend.
- The plugin sends `browser` and `browser_start` only on the exec leg of the session's browser device (section 3.2), which must belong to the session's hub user: the plugin knows each device's user from the hub's signed assertion, never uses a service device, and refuses a choice or a device whose user is not the session's. A session is bound to a computer only by that computer, over its own token, by its owner on the hub ("Move to computer", Telegram `/move`, where the hub refuses another user's computer; hub README, Devices), or by the plugin's `/device` command, which refuses a computer of another hub user than the session's (the user of the computer the session is bound to, else the plugin setting `user`, else the one hub user whose computers are connected). A session bound to a service device by hand has no browser there. So browser operations reach only devices the user owns, as commands do, and another hub user's agent cannot reach this browser. The hub does not check browser requests itself; the plugin's routing decides, as it does for commands.
- The hub forwards exec leg messages unchanged; it does not read or rewrite browser messages.
- Removing the computer under Settings, Computers on the hub, or stopping `talaria run`, ends browser control for it. Disabling the extension ends it for that Firefox.

What this does not cover:

- Any process of the same OS user can connect to the socket, edit the host manifest, read the Firefox profile or read the device token. Browser control adds no boundary against them, and none against a command the agent runs on the device as that user (the exec leg already allows that inside the device's roots).
- The agent drives whichever Firefox of that OS user last connected with the extension, with that profile's cookies, in its tab group (section 8).

### 13.1 History

talaria v0.7.0 to v0.15.0 and talaria-hub v0.8.0 to v0.14.0 made Firefox sign in to the hub with `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow`, PKCE and a consent page, and the hub refused browser operations until the browser was signed in as the device's owner. That was removed: the sign-in added a second credential that any process of the same OS user could read from the profile, so it bounded nothing that the OS user and the device pairing do not already bound, and it cost every user a sign-in per browser. The exec leg messages `browser_auth` and `browser_auth_result`, the code `not_signed_in`, the `signed_in`, `user` and `reason` members of `browser_status`, the broker messages `auth`, `auth_status`, `sign_in` and `sign_out`, and the `identity` and `storage` permissions are gone. A new device ignores a `browser_auth_result`, and a new plugin ignores `signed_in`. So that extensions from those releases that hold a sign-in keep working until Firefox updates them, the daemon still sends `{"type": "auth_status", "state": "signed_in"}` after `config`; those extensions ran requests only with a stored token and after that message, and newer ones ignore it. One that never signed in refuses requests until Firefox updates it.
