# Telegram

Talaria can run a Telegram bot, so you can chat with your agent, approve its actions and get notices from your phone. It is optional.

You need:

- A Telegram account.
- A bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- HTTPS for your hub, if you want the links in Telegram to open your hub. Chatting works without it.

## Make a bot

1. In Telegram, open a chat with @BotFather and send `/newbot`.
2. Pick a name and a user name ending in `bot`, for example `alice_talaria_bot`.
3. BotFather replies with a token that looks like `123456789:AA...`. Keep it secret: whoever has it controls the bot.

## Turn it on

**In the hub (any install):** sign in as an admin, open **Settings, Telegram**, paste the token, click **Test**,
then **Save and start**. The bot starts at once, without a restart. The hub keeps the token in its own database,
sealed with a key from its secrets; nobody can read it back in Settings. **Stop** turns the bot off again.

A token set by the install (below) wins over one set in Settings, and Settings then shows the bot read-only.

**Compose:** put the token in `.env` and apply:

```sh
TALARIA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:AA...
```

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

**Helm:**

```sh
kubectl -n talaria create secret generic talaria-telegram --from-literal=token=123456789:AA...
helm upgrade talaria ./talaria -n talaria --reset-then-reuse-values --set telegram.existingSecret=talaria-telegram
```

**All-in-one:** set `TALARIA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` on the container.

## Link your account

1. Open your bot in Telegram and send `/link`.
2. The bot sends a link. Open it, log in to the hub if asked, and confirm. Only that confirmation links the accounts. A link works once and expires after 10 minutes.

3. Send the bot a message. It goes to your agent, and the reply streams back.

In the hub, Settings, Telegram shows whether your account is linked and how replies show their steps.

Each person on your hub links their own Telegram account. People who are not linked get nothing from the bot.

## What you can do

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `/new [backend]` | Start a new chat |
| `/stop` | Stop the running turn |
| `/model` | Show the chat's model, with buttons to switch |
| `/status` | Show the model and how full the context is |
| `/prompts` | Your saved prompts: tap one to get its text to copy |
| `/bg TEXT` | Run a prompt in the background |
| `/sessions`, `/attach N`, `/backends` | List chats, attach to chat N of that list, list backends |
| `/devices`, `/new NAME [folder]`, `/where`, `/move NAME [folder]` | List your computers, start a chat on one, see where this chat runs, move it (`/move off` stops using the chat's computer). Shown when computers are set up |
| `/link`, `/unlink` | Link or unlink your account (`/link` works in a direct message, or in a group with Topics) |
| `/help` | The command list |

When the agent wants to run something that needs your approval, the bot shows the command with buttons: Once, This chat, Always and Deny. You can also send photos, files, voice notes and PDFs to the bot, and they go to the chat as attachments.

## A topic for each chat

You can have one topic per chat, so replies of different chats never mix. Either:

- Turn on topic mode for the bot in the @BotFather Mini App. Then your private chat with the bot gets a topic per chat. Or
- Make a private group, turn on Topics in the group settings, add the bot, make it an admin that can manage topics and delete messages, and send `/link` in the group. Every member sees every topic, so keep the group to yourself.

## Things to know

- Only one process can read a bot's messages at a time. Do not run the same token in two places. If the bot does not answer, see [Telegram does not answer](troubleshooting.md#telegram-does-not-answer).
- Telegram limits how often a bot can send. Long turns update one status message in place instead of sending many.
- The bot answers files larger than 20 MB with a note, because Telegram does not let bots download them.
- For the bot's links to open the right address, set the public URL to the address you use in the browser.
