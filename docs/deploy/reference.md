# Install settings (.env and Helm values)

The listings on this page (the `.env` file, the service list, the chart, the values and the images) are generated from the files in the repository, so they match the version you downloaded. The hub's own settings are on [Hub settings](../../hub/docs/configuration.md); the hub is the `talaria-hub` program in the image `ghcr.io/usa-reddragon/talaria-hub`, and every setting there except `users[]` and `backends[]` is also an environment variable that starts with `HUB_`.

## Compose settings (.env)

Every setting is optional. Copy `deploy/compose/.env.example` to `.env` and change what you need, then run `docker compose up -d`. The `init` service writes the configs again from `.env` on every start and never changes a secret it made.

<!-- docgen:code file=deploy/compose/.env.example -->
```
# Talaria settings for docker compose. Copy this file to .env and change what you need.
# Every setting is optional. Secrets that Talaria needs inside are made for you on the first start.

# --- Where people open Talaria ---
# Port on this host
TALARIA_PORT=8080
# The address in the browser. Empty: http://localhost:<TALARIA_PORT>, for this computer only. Use
# https://<your domain> behind HTTPS, or http://<this host's address>:<TALARIA_PORT> on a LAN. Pages and push
# notifications need HTTPS or localhost.
TALARIA_PUBLIC_URL=
# For automatic HTTPS from Caddy: your domain name (also publish ports 80 and 443, see https://usa-reddragon.github.io/talaria/deploy/compose.html)
# TALARIA_SITE=talaria.example.com
# Where the certificate comes from. Empty: Let's Encrypt (the domain must point at this host, ports 80 and 443
# open). An email address: the same, with that contact. internal: Caddy's own CA, for a LAN or a test; then
# browsers and computers must trust its root (https://usa-reddragon.github.io/talaria/deploy/compose.html)
# TALARIA_TLS=internal

# --- Accounts ---
# There is no admin password here: the first person who opens Talaria makes the admin account on its setup
# page. Other login options (your OIDC provider, or a reverse proxy such as Authelia): https://usa-reddragon.github.io/talaria/deploy/auth.html
# The hub account of the person this agent works for, once it exists (optional). Names that person in Honcho
# memory, and owns chats that are on no computer. Empty: works while one person's computers are paired
TALARIA_USER=
# Contact address that push services get with Web Push, such as mailto:you@example.com. Empty: the public URL
# when that is https (push notifications need https anyway)
TALARIA_PUSH_CONTACT=

# --- Model ---
# After the first start, open Talaria and click Connect a model. Or, from this folder, the agent's own setup:
#   docker compose exec -u hermes hermes hermes model
# (see the docs page "Choosing models and providers"). Provider keys that the agent reads from its environment,
# such as OPENROUTER_API_KEY, can go in compose.override.yaml under hermes: environment:.
#
# Optional parts to start, comma-separated: demo, ollama, honcho, honcho-embeddings.
# demo: a stand-in model that needs no API key, to try Talaria. The agent then offers it as the provider
# talaria-demo; pick it with "hermes model". ollama: Ollama on this host (its address for the agent:
# http://ollama:11434/v1).
COMPOSE_PROFILES=
# Ollama's own setting: the context window it serves. The agent needs at least 64K
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536
# With profile ollama: a model to download on start, such as llama3.1:8b (it needs tool calls and a 64K window)
TALARIA_OLLAMA_PULL=

# --- Web search ---
# The agent searches the web through its own SearXNG, which runs next to it and is not reachable from outside.
# 1: on (the default). 0: off; then the agent uses whatever web search you set up in it, if any
TALARIA_SEARXNG=1

# --- Images ---
# Another agent image, such as one you built or loaded (the default is pinned by digest)
# TALARIA_HERMES_IMAGE=ghcr.io/usa-reddragon/talaria-hermes:v0.23.1-p54

# --- Time zone of schedules and the agent's clock (IANA name, such as Europe/Berlin). Empty: UTC
TZ=

# --- Telegram bot (optional): a token from @BotFather
TALARIA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=

# --- Long-term memory with Honcho (optional) ---
# Add honcho to COMPOSE_PROFILES and set:
#   TALARIA_HONCHO_URL=http://honcho:8000
# Embeddings: add honcho-embeddings to COMPOSE_PROFILES for a small local model (about 1 GB of RAM), or use a
# hosted API, for example OpenAI:
#   TALARIA_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
#   TALARIA_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
#   TALARIA_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY=sk-...
#   TALARIA_EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSIONS=1536
# Honcho needs its own model for what it learns (Honcho's setting): TALARIA_HONCHO_LLM_BASE_URL,
# TALARIA_HONCHO_LLM_API_KEY and TALARIA_HONCHO_MODEL, an OpenAI-compatible API. Default: the demo model.
TALARIA_HONCHO_URL=

## Web search

The agent searches the web through its own [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org), a free metasearch engine that
runs next to it: no API key and no account. It is on by default. Only the agent reaches it: compose runs it as the
`searxng` service with no published port, the Helm chart as the Deployment and ClusterIP Service
`<release>-searxng`, and the all-in-one image runs it inside the container on 127.0.0.1. Its
key is made on the first start and kept with the other secrets. Its settings are
[`deploy/searxng/settings.yml`](../../deploy/searxng/settings.yml) (the JSON API on, no rate limiter, as one local
client uses it).

- **Turn it off:** compose: `TALARIA_SEARXNG=0` in `.env`, then `docker compose up -d`. All-in-one:
  `TALARIA_SEARXNG=false`. Helm: `--set searxng.enabled=false`. The agent then uses whatever web search is set up
  in it, if any.
- **Use another search provider:** set it up in the agent, for example with
  `docker compose exec -u hermes hermes hermes tools` (or `web.search_backend` in the agent's `config.yaml`).
  Talaria points web search at SearXNG only while no search provider is chosen there, so your choice wins and
  stays.
- **Use your own SearXNG:** give the agent `SEARXNG_URL` (compose: in `compose.override.yaml` under
  `hermes: environment:`; Helm: `hermes.env.SEARXNG_URL`) and turn the bundled one off.
