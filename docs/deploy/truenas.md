# Install on TrueNAS SCALE

TrueNAS SCALE 24.10 (Electric Eel) and later run apps with Docker Compose. Talaria installs as a custom app from
YAML, with the all-in-one image ([design](all-in-one.md)). Tested on TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.

1. **Datasets**: add two datasets with the **Apps** preset, for example `tank/apps/talaria/hermes` and
   `tank/apps/talaria/talaria`.
2. **Apps**, **Discover Apps**, the menu (three dots) next to **Custom App**, **Install via YAML**.

   ![The Discover Apps page of TrueNAS, with the Custom App button and the menu next to it at the top right](images/truenas/discover.png)

3. Name it `talaria` and paste the file below. Change the lines marked `CHANGE`: your TrueNAS address in
   `TALARIA_PUBLIC_URL`, and the dataset paths. To try Talaria without a provider, also set `TALARIA_DEMO` to
   `"true"` (as in the picture).

   ![The Install via YAML form: the name talaria and the compose file pasted in the Custom Config box](images/truenas/install-yaml.png)

4. **Save**. The first start downloads about 1.2 GB; the app shows **Running** under **Apps, Installed** within a
   minute or two.

   ![The Installed apps page: talaria is Running, and Workloads lists port 8080 and the talaria container](images/truenas/app-running.png)

5. Open `http://<TrueNAS address>:8080` right away (custom apps have no **Web UI** button). The setup page makes the
   first account, an admin; the first person who opens it gets that account. Add other people under Settings,
   Users.

   ![The Talaria setup page with the user name alice and a display name filled in](images/truenas/setup.png)

6. **Connect a model.** This step is required: until you do it, the chat area says Talaria has no model yet.
   Talaria includes its own agent, the part that talks to models, so you need nothing else.

   As the admin, click **Connect a model** in the chat area (it shows until a model is connected; later it is
   in Settings, Models) and pick where the model runs: a server of your own (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp),
   a provider with an API key, or a subscription sign-in. Talaria checks the address or key through the agent, lets
   you pick the model new chats start with, and keeps nothing itself: the agent stores the provider and key.
   [Choosing models and providers](models.md) walks through each kind.

   Or open a shell in the container: **Apps**, **Installed**, `talaria`,
   then under **Workloads**, **Containers**, the shell icon (the first icon next to `talaria – Running`). That
   shell runs as root; run the agent's own setup command as its own user:

   ```bash
   runuser -u hermes -- hermes model
   ```

   From **System, Shell** or SSH instead:
   `sudo docker exec -it -u hermes $(sudo docker ps -qf name=talaria) hermes model`.

   You will see a list of providers; move with the arrow keys. Pick one and give it what it asks for (an API
   key, a sign-in, or an address). With `TALARIA_DEMO` on, `talaria-demo` is near the end of the list (Enter,
   then Enter for its one model). For Ollama, LM Studio or vLLM, pick **Custom endpoint** (see
   [Ollama as a TrueNAS app](#ollama-as-a-truenas-app)). It asks for a display name at the end: it becomes
   the group your models show under in the chat's model menu.

   Then open a new chat (or reload the page) and pick the model in the chat's model menu. No restart is needed,
   and models you pull into Ollama later appear on their own. Details: [Choosing models and providers](models.md).

`PUID` and `PGID` 568 are the TrueNAS `apps` user, which owns datasets with the Apps preset. `stop_grace_period: 2m` lets a stop wait for running replies to finish.

## Ollama as a TrueNAS app

1. **Apps**, **Discover Apps**, search for **Ollama**, **Install**. Under **Additional Environment Variables**, add
   `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` = `65536` (Ollama's setting). Note the API port (the app's default is `30068`). Under
   **Resources Configuration**, the default limit of 2 CPUs and 4096 MB is too small for a 64K window: give it the
   CPUs you can spare and at least 8192 MB for a 3B model. Without a GPU, `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE` = `q8_0` halves
   the memory the window takes.

   ![The Ollama install form with OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH 65536 and OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE q8_0 added](images/truenas/ollama-install.png)

2. Download a model that handles tool calls and a 64K window: open the **ollama** app's container shell (as for
   Talaria above) and run `ollama pull`. `llama3.1:8b` suits a GPU or 16 GB to spare; `llama3.2:3b` (2 GB) runs on
   a CPU but slowly.

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:3b
   ```

   ![ollama pull llama3.2:3b in the Ollama container shell, then ollama show with a 131072 context length and the tools capability](images/truenas/ollama-pull.png)

3. Point the agent at it: `runuser -u hermes -- hermes model` in the Talaria shell, **Custom endpoint** (right after
   `talaria-demo` and **Local models**), API base URL `http://<TrueNAS address>:30068/v1`, then Enter for the rest:
   no API key, auto-detect, the model it found, an empty context length (the agent asks Ollama for the window it
   serves, 65536 here, not the model's maximum of 131072), the display name and the reasoning effort.

![A Talaria chat on llama3.2:3b: it ran uname -r with a command (shown as "Ran a command") and answered "The kernel version is 6.12.113-production+truenas"](images/truenas/chat-ollama.png)

On 4 CPU cores, that first answer took about ten minutes (the agent sends about 13K tokens of instructions and
tools). Use a GPU or a provider for daily use.

More in [Choosing models and providers](models.md#ollama).

## If something goes wrong

Open the app's logs under **Apps**, **Installed**, `talaria`, or run `sudo docker logs $(sudo docker ps -qf name=talaria)` in **System, Shell**. The container's health check passes once the agent and the hub both answer, and it allows 3 minutes after a start before a failure counts.

- The page refuses to log you in: open Talaria at exactly the address in `TALARIA_PUBLIC_URL`.
- The app does not start: read the log, and check that both dataset paths in the file exist (Datasets, preset Apps, as in step 1).
- The chat says Talaria has no model yet: do the **Connect a model** step above.

More in [Fix server problems](troubleshooting.md).

## A TrueNAS catalog entry (not done yet)

The TrueNAS apps catalog (github.com/truenas/apps) takes an app as `ix-dev/community/<name>/` with `app.yaml`,
`questions.yaml` (the install form) and `templates/docker-compose.yaml` rendered by their Python library. A Talaria
entry would ask for the public URL, the model settings and two storage locations, and render the same single
service as the file above. It can use the published all-in-one image.
